Yeah but come on, this is just a song and dance. He's going to get behind Trump and everyone knows it. His political relevance depends on it. 
I'm not sure if it's edited to just look like that, but I love that part where Seth says "I thought Trump was running as a Joke!" and Trump just gives a cold stare. He shows total resolve when doesn't even blink. 
I don't think people realize how much of a cuck this guy is. Almost all of his 'Closer look' segments are smear attacks against Trump.
We desperately need a sequel to this. That revolves around Cruz, Kasich and Trump all the way through the Indiana victory. DESPERATELY NEED IT.
This couldn't have gone better with the song if Trump himself made it.
Next classical Trump video needs to be either Beethoven's 5th, Dvorak's 9th or Tchaikovsky's Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy.
I'm not sure if [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W7I92r9GqUw) has been stickied yet or not but it's the dankest Trump video I know of, and may be worth a nightly video slot eventually

"What is Trump's kryptonite?"

#TRUMP = SUPERMAN CONFIRMED
I've watched this around 100 times over the months. The best Trump video on youtube, for me. 
Donald Trump is going to be the next president of the United States of America. Plain and simple.
Can we get a new one  updated with Trump becoming the Nominee? 
Does Hillary even realize what Trump is going to do to her during the first debate? She already has anger issues. He is going to either make her lose her mind or seem weak and feckless on international TV. 


You Can't Stump The Trump^(TM) 

Unlike the other crapweasels we've ever nominated, Trump will unload on her with both barrels then buy two more when those wear out. She'll be too busy getting carpet bombed by everything that's ever gone wrong in her life to be able to convincingly fight back.

Ron Reagan and Luis Gutierrez calling Trump a clown? That's rich. 
I laugh my ass off every time I see this. Trump just let the hate roll of him like water off a ducks back. Now he'll be our next president! Time for the media ass kissing to begin!
That's what I was thinking.  This is actually the only thing I've seen that I find relatable about her.  It's kind of like the ads with Trump cursing over and over again.  Doesn't have the intended effect.
Fake. This women is a cold-blooded psychopath, as ruthless as they come. She'll do and say anything for power and kill anyone that gets in her way. No qualms. 

Google all of the mysterious deaths associated with the Clintons, literally dozens of people have turned up dead. When we say that we're worried about an assassination plot aimed at Trump, we're not exaggerating.  
Complaining about downvotes only attracts more. I see your points, but this muslim insulted Trump and everyone here, don't expect up votes for defending him. It's just how public opinion works.
Sadiq should be mocking Erdogan or any of the Saudi princes if he wants to earn our respect.  The Middle East is unravelling before our eyes and you can only spend so much time blaming Donald Trump for your fucking problems
Americans are already unhappy about London voting for a Muslim mayor. This endorsement would only mobilize Americans into voting for Trump. Thanks, at least there's one good thing to come out of this stupid London election. 
The media has made Muslims and liberals think they have this major movement going on, that people are starting to realize that they are not all terrorists and sympathize with them. But what is really happening is that everyone is seeing just how bad even the "moderate" ones are. Even SJW types are finding it hard to ignore how incompatible Muslim beliefs are with Western society. 

This is a huge endorsement for Trump. Americans are done worrying about peoples feelings. They will not let what happened to Europe happen here.




I think a great Trump ad would be to show a montage of all the refugee mayhem in Europe, followed by the caption in bold letters:

EUROPE IS LOST

IT'S NOT TO LATE FOR AMERICA.
> Great endorsement

No doubt!

The more that foreigners attack Trump, the more the American people are going to rally around him. Trump got in this clown's head and now he's actively campaigning to get Trump elected.
He should just keep it up, with wonderful arguments like Trump should not say things to upset the moderate/mainstream muslims. 

Put against a backdrop of 66% UK muslims would not inform police of people they knew who where involved with or supported terrorism....
Or how 38% of ALL muslims are perfectly OK with suicide bombings now and then:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_attitudes_towards_terrorism#Condemnation_and_opposition

Trump has every motherfucking right to stop these "peaceful" people from easily getting into the US.
Trump has openly posed threats against muslims, so why would muslims not be involved?
Sure, happy to! Whether you're an atheist or Christian or whatever, it saddens me to see Christianity slandered or mocked by patriotic Americans (and brits!) 

The first and most obvious reason is that Britain has a long Christian history, and developed freedom and its eventually its empire as a Christian nation - much of it as an ostensible theocracy, seeing as the King Henry declared himself the leader of the church of England in 1534, and before that the king was "subject" to the Pope. 

Additionally, the church in Europe has been the focal point of scientific discovery and philosophy since the "dark" ages (which weren't dark), this makes sense seeing as how monks were a huge portion of the literate population at the time. 

For example, Sir Francis Bacon, known as the father of empiricism (aka basically invented modern science) was a devout Christian, who was educated at Trinity College, which is of course named after the Holy Trinity. Sir Isaac Newton, known if course for his profound research on apples, was also educated at Trinity and a devout Christian. 

Specifically regarding freedom and government, the Magna Carta, which I'm sure (I hope) you know of, was written by the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is recognized as he foundation for the very idea of democracy or self determination. 

As for Americans, we have William Blackstone, a famous British legal philosopher to thank for our freedom, amongst other prolific Christian Brits such as Locke. Blackstone wrote about "absolute rights" and natural rights which come from the creator and not from any man. This of course was embodied by Jefferson's "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." 

So yes I would say unequivocally that Christianity is the inventor of Western democracy and freedom, in Britain and America, praise Jesus and thank God for Donald Trump 


Forgive me Trump, for I have sinned!
and Trump suggested the opposite.
Trump is even more Presidential than the President.
No, especially when he's vowing to help Trump win via an absolutely horrid endorsement for Hillary and a left handed endorsement for Trump. 
It only makes Trump stronger.
> The London mayor said Trump’s proposed ban on anyone of Islamic faith entering the U.S. affected his own family because it would stop his teenage daughters **visiting Disneyland.**

This must be a joke.
It's the best way to endorse Trump, folks!
Brit here. And a huge Trump supporter. 

Yes, I think it's very wrong for him to openly interfere. I feel angry that he is abusing his official position as Mayor of London and using it as a platform to influence American politics. Who Americans choose as their leader is none of his business. 

However, I also think this will help Trump. When Obama came to tell us to remain in the EU, the 'leave' side got a spike in the polls. People don't like being told what to do by other countries. 
"So you've just been elected mayor. What are some things you can do to improve London"

"I declare war on the United States."

"Um. Uhhh. Okay, so tha-"

"I will help Hillary Defeat Trump for President of the United States"

"Why? What about London?"

"What's London?
All these foreign Muslims sure want to stop Donald Trump.
I don't think Khan realizes what a favor he just did Trump.
Why does anyone care what foreigners who worship a pedophile warlord have to say about Trump?
It's alarming how anti-Trump our media and government is. He has to be doing something right if they truly see him as a threat. Their own personal interests would be compromised if he were to be elected.
This is just going to make Trumps win even greater.
Like everything else opponents of El Trumpo try to pull, have a feeling this ploy is going to backfire in spectacular fashion.  

If I'm Trump, I enthusiastically mention Khan is support Hillary, the same guy that threatened the United States by saying Muslim's will attack us if we don't let them in.
Not only uncomfortable, but it's actually horrifying. If you told me a year ago about how corrupt our msm was and there being a plan to spread Islam I'd have called you a crazy conspiracy theorist. Growing up I'd see these people being shamed for knowing what's outside the mainstream box. Now I *am* one of "those people". 

Now I see how corrupt our msm is and how they no longer hide the fact they want a pathological liar who happens to be a criminal to be our next president.  I see how Islam *is* being spread only to the western "white" countries. If Hillary did become the next president of our united states, we would be flooded with third world Muslims, no borders, the rich get richer and Americans would no longer have any freedom. Trump is really our only hope. 
I think it helps Trump. Nobody likes foreigners especially those with islamist leanings fucking with their elections. 
What, like Trump saying Britain would be better off outside the EU before next month's referendum?  (Or of course Obama saying the opposite!)
Yeah, this is extremely disturbing tbh.  More inspiration to vote for Trump, though. 

I'd vote Hillary for president just as soon as Dubai elects its first Christian mayor. 
Doesn't this clown have a job to do as mayor of London? He's like goofy warren tweeting Trump when congress is in session. 
This is only going to work in Trump's favor. Just like when people were waving Mexican flags at the California protests, it's going to create an outrage amongst voters. Nobody likes it when foreign entities try to manipulate them and threaten their (KEYWORD) opinions onto people. Voting against Hillary is how people can "silently" fight back. Sadiq Khan might think he's doing something honorable, but he is only creating a wider barrier between Muslims and the American people.
He will only make Trump's support hate him and Hillary even more. 

#FOOLISH MAYOR
I just love that the Democrats are essentially stuck with her. She will rack up enough delegates to be their nominee in the next week or two because the superdelegates are literally bought and paid for.


They all think that Trump is stuck in the room with them...

###YOU. ARE STUCK IN HERE. WITH THE GOD EMPEROR.
Ah, maybe Muhammad Achmed Allah Fuckboi is what will finally stump the Trump.

Muhammad Khan donates to Muslim Hitlery. 

Holy fucking shit. Sadiq Muhumud Mudslime Khan is going to get btfo out by the god emperor.

MAGA
This is a mistake on Khan's part, he is falling for the same trap the media has which has only helped propel the god emperor into the stratosphere. If Khan is going to start being really vocal with his anti-Trump rhetoric it will only make Americans even more pro-Trump because if there is anything that makes people spiteful and pissed off it is when a foreign leader tries to dictate what would be best for your country. Fuck you Khan, let Americans decide what is best for their country and don't try to force adherence to the political pressures of yet another self-serving Muslim dignitary attempting to buy off the American presidency from abroad. 
Well our president was over in the UK promising everyone a blowjob if they voted NO on Brexit. 

Americans hate to be told what to do, so a foreign Muslim mayor telling us how to vote will only help Trump. 
This is border-line illegal. Foreign nationals cannot contribute to American campaigns, directly or "indirectly." On the other hand, having some pro-Hillary diffident foreign Muslim go around and lecture Americans on their inferiority might fairly be considered a donation to Trump.
I wonder how much Sadiq got paid to have s%&t come out of his mouth and possibly start a Crusades pt. 2. Globalization can **not** work...and the rich oil Muslim princes know this and pay off the gullibility of the 'elite' globalists...and then will turn their back on the paid-off infidels/globalists and try to establish sharia law. **This can not, and will not, happen. Trump is a front-runner to stop this**.
Embarrassing for his constituents.  Especially after Trump wins in a landslide.
How is this going to get Trump to lose supporters? I never understand how these people think this will work.. like what are you gonna do, tell Trump supporters there racist for voting for him and should stop? Give me a break..
Nothing new, Soros has been funding libtards to protest Trump rallies. He owns the New York Times and has been running Anti-Trump banter 24/7 since he heard Trump will close out the human trafficking racket.
Every time this little, unimportant weasel speaks out, it will help Trump. Go for it, knock yourself out! Proves Trumps point regarding muslims.
No such thing as a moderate muslim. I refuse to capitalize muslim.
>The London mayor, who insisted he was not a “Muslim leader or Muslim spokesperson,” said Trump’s proposed ban on anyone of Islamic faith entering the U.S. affected his own family because it would stop his teenage daughters visiting Disneyland.

So he admits that in his view London is now an Islamic State? Because the policy would only affect Muslims from Islamic States from my understanding.
Tired of hearing about this guy bitching about Trump why doesn't he just focus on London and not a country that he doesn't even live in. 
Since when did ANYONE care what the Mayor of London had to fucking say?? Until it became negative against Donald Trump..
Trump has been through the ringer with every media outlet against him. Some shitty mudslime isn't going to do anything
Not uncomfortable at all. The media will probably ignore this until late September and then unleash a "World Leaders Against Trump" campaign that imo will be useless. The mayor of London isn't a "World Leader" but you can bet your ass that the media will make it appear that way.
so another fool is gonna get 420 stumped in the next volume of "can't stump the Trump"
I think Hillary is almost as scary as Trump. The Mayor wouldn't be jumping on this bandwagon if the opposing party to Trump in question was not led by a woman... Hate to say it, but it's absolutely true 
Let him try.

Lindsay Graham, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Oliver, and Mitt Romney also tried to stop the Trump Train^^TM 

I imagine Sadiq Khan's efforts will yield the same result.
This is just a small indication of how the US will be viewed on the world stage if Trump is elected. One thing Donald doesn't seem to get is that by alienating the rest of the world the US economy will tank. No economy can survive in today's world market without good trade relationships with other countries. That is why it is called the WORLD MARKET. Who does he think invents in all these US companies? 

I DO NOT advocate people from other nations getting in involved in another countries politics but it very hypocritical for anyone in the US to say it shouldn't be done. The US has a very long history of interjecting their ideals and will on foreign soil. 
Trumps 3rd wife is a foreigner. So it's too late for that.
Well yeah, but that's one of the things Trump wants to cut back on. No more world police!

wait a fucking second....here you guys are loving how Putin may release emails that would bring hillary down, but when something on the opposite spectrum happens, you all cry foul. 

Im all for Trump for president, but we cant play double standards and come out looking better than the bitch. I am uncomfortable with emails being released by Putin, even if it does incriminate and bring her down. Let the FBI do it. Internally and not have external factors. Same goes for that fucking disgrace of a goatfucking Muslim "mayor" of London. Keep your goat milk drinking ass out of our affairs.

Trump wants to get out of nation building. That's the difference.
Trump is specifically against nation building like bush, clinton, and obama. Watch his foreign policy speech.
I love how in Trump's recent CNN interview he calls them this. 

Who else though? If it is just her that's damning. Most likely never to Trump but I wonder how many others they have donated to and how much. If she's just a drop in the bucket does it mean that much? 
The Old Clinton News Network. Part of it is regional, Atlanta/South/Arkansas, etc.
But there is an old DC to the media pipeline in MSM.

CNN Hired the ultra-nasty, tough as nails Clinton people Begala and Carville years ago. "Politics of personal destruction". This was a major Clinton innovation. These were the main agents of that.

Now to Stephanopolis, Cuomo and a string of lightweight newsreader chicks talking to DNC plants on a rotation. Stiff Hillary clones, emotionless. Looking desperately for a killer like Carville.
 
Nobody is even close yet. And Carville's sell by date has passed.

Rolled out fauXcahontas. 
Goofy.

Kill shot TrumpStamp. Right hook to the head, she is bleeding out of her new tattoo.

Break in the armor with Cuomo. Cuomo likes the ratings. Likes beating Fox. Knows he needs Trump for that. DT knows it too. Cuomo Politely thanks Trump for coming each time, politely thanks trump for handing him his arse.
Every time.

Great fun, and a nice change in the weather.
Memes have a Trump bias, so it's all good.
So I used to work for time warner, and no joke Trump called to cancel his business class service a few years ago and apparently there was no negotiations with the man. He was simply to good.
Trump donated money to her, too.

also /u/TrumpGal you never acknowledged my offer for marriage im a bit peeved :(
I bet lots of people are trying to be an intern right now. Think about it--Trump only picks the best people. If you are chosen, thats basically like a mandate from the God-Emperor himself.

I don't think that internship position is just about social media.  There's also options for voter services, data, and communications.

That being said, Trump does have a very competent social media guy- Dan Scavino.  He's doing a better job than all $1 million of Correct the Record.
Like, I'd be kinda spooked to do it in California. I'd be fine for phonebanking, but I couldn't imagine going door to door to praise Trump of all people in Commiefornia, good way to get shot unfortunately. 
I seriously believe that /pol/ and r/the_Donald have made SIGNIFICANT contributions to the success of Mr. Trump's campaign. Many young internet users who denounced him in late 2015 now support him.
I'm not sure. I'm currently in middle school, going into highschool in the coming year, but I'd like to join the team anyways, since I've done a lot of work to help the Trump campaign. (Made /r/the_donald's snoo, which was also used as their Twitter logo, and some other graphic design stuff.) I'm crossing my fingers as much as you are.
I'v already interned in 2012 where can I apply for a real job? I don't require a high salary I just want to #MAGA. I'm down to go door to door and get Trump supporters registered.
My skill set is far too advanced and time too valuable. I feel Trump would understand and not slight me for it.
Anyone know if this is paid or not? Would love to spend all summer working for the Trump campaign but can't afford to not work a paying job this summer. 
Seriously considering rejecting my Facebook internship and work for Trump instead. If I can get Facebook this year, I'll be able to get it next year, but I WILL NEVER GET A CHANCE TO INTERN FOR TRUMP AGAIN!
Don't fire Cuckerberg until you sign on with Trump and its 100% confirmed. 
The internal Trump motto for the campaign is "Let Trump be Trump"

I shit you not
If you put this job on your linkedin profile, you run the risk of being harassed by SJWs.

It'll be hard to ever put this on your resume, unless you plan on entering politics, rising with Trump.
Who wants to bet this starts out like The Apprentice, where he gives all the interns $50 and tells them to go out and come up with the most effective advertising idea you can for that budget.  And the women win by offering kisses if you buy this $5 Trump2016 lemonade.

And here i thought i missed my chance to get an internship by being lazy and not applying for any! I was secretly just keeping my schedule open until the great Trump let me in!
It's exactly like Trump said, his tough talk has only made them like and respect him more. 
You don't? It's getCurrentYear()!

    func getCurrentYear() -> String {
        let dateFormatter = NSDateFormatter()
        dateFormatter.dateFormat = "yyyy"
        let currentYear = dateFormatter.stringFromDate(NSDate())
        return currentYear
    }

I've never even heard of powershell.exe before. Trump is already improving our nation's education!

The Chinese government wants Hillary. The Chinese people respect Trump.  The Chinese people have spent a long time dealing with crooked leaders.  Seems like they have some good perspective.
The Chinese govt is split now. Especially after Trump's foreign policy speech, I've noticed. 

They prefer him over Clinton despite his threatening trade war with them. That is just how much they dislike Clinton.

Everyone keeps underestimating how bad her foreign policy history was.

So Trump said China is raping the U.S. economy and citizens their still prefer him over Crooked Hillary.

**MADMAN!!!**
I agree. To be clear, I'm not criticizing Trump for telling the truth, I love it. Also love the fact that citizens in that country, seem to even know what is going on. Media censorship and all. 
Because he's telling the truth. Trump never said they were responsible for it — the people responsible are US citizens letting China get away with.

So close! but we have based football fans too, not just Trump fans! You were not wrong! 😉
Trumpettes are a rainbow of people. 

fuck you media.
The Chinese are a very nationalistic people. Liberals can't understand how Trump could possible have any appeal to the Chinese. After all, he threatened their country with tariffs.

But the Chinese understand national leaders looking after the interests of their nation. People like Obama, Hillary, Cruz.... they make no sense to the Chinese. How could you seek to lead a nation and not put it first?

EDIT: It worries me that the COMMUNIST PARTY of China is by great orders of magnitude less naive than our liberals. It does not bode well for us.

If you don't agree with anything else about trump, he is worth a vote to save our 1st amendment alone. 

And do you guys know one of our China social media Weibo's Trump fans account that has nearly 10000 followers got censored like a month ago? I was furious! furious! furious! but then I found the_Donald, and it is my home now. Can't leave here for 10 mins.
Where do I find the dank Chinese Trump memes at? Can you link us to some good Weibo accounts? 

My Chinese is pretty shit but I'd love to see what people are saying.
the biggest fans account along with a couple of related pro—Trump accounts has been censored! so right now the owner opened another account and had to start over with zero followers, but since he or she has to keep it low key, it's no more fun than it was before, and the update frequency dropped as well. It's way more high energy here than our Weibo. Just hang out here! I know some superfans on Weibo draw material from the_Donald anyways.
If you don't vote for Trump, then there's Sum Ting Wong with you.
Wow notice because China doesn't have identity politics like Mexico they don't get butthurt when Trump uses tough talk against China like Mexico does? They understand its rhetoric and campaign talk. Mr. Trump makes it clear he respect the Chinese people, he's just mad at our leaders for being so incompetent against the Chinese government in trade.

It makes sense they like a no-bullshit leader like Trump. Better than Racist Sexist Clinton who has a hard-on against men and Chinese people (but loves everyone else).

Also in China the consensus now is people preferred "Honest down to earth" Bush to "Snake tongued bullshit artist" Obama.

So he was basically campaigning for Cruz and full anti-Trump. But his plans did not work. Because he thought Cruz would win, and he would have had a lot for consevative fans. And maybe become another Glenn Beck. 

But, Cruz got humiliated. Trump kept winning. He started losing fans like me that used to respect him. He only got some new liberal fans, and some hardcore anti-Trump insane people. The Glenn Beck crowd. 

And ever since The Michelle Fiends Hoax failed. And Trump kept on winning, and won the nomination, he has been losing his mind. Because he corrupted himself and his career into a corner. 

Most people know he took the money to be anti-Trump. 

But now he only has 2 choices for his future. Either become a liberal and support Hillary, so that if she wins, he will have liberal fans. 

Or accept defeat, and support Trump, and regain back some Trump supporters when he wins. 

Either than those 2, and his internet career is now only going to be jokes about him, trolling on him, and humiliation. Lost a lot of respect from Republicans. He cucked himself. 

Its like Beck. Went full retard. And his whole business failed. Cruz needed to win for Beck to succeed. 

But now Beck knows his whole business is in trouble. Thats why he is trying to come back. But its too late for him too. 

Both snakes. 

The difference is, Shapiro could still bring it back, but it will take him eating a lot of humble pie and admitting he lies/lied. And was corrupt. 

Nobody will buy his books again, or take him that seriously in young Republicans. 


Yeah. Mike Cernovich is a lawyer. He is on twitter. Very popular.  And he directly traces who funds things often. You easily can to some political pundits. Like Mark Levin, who sold out too. 

Its not even "illegal" persay. But they do it in legal manner. Like the Superpac is legal. So they can make "contributions", and these have to be kind of reported for taxes. Or through "charitable organizatons"

So he went and check who sponsors and funds Ben Shapiro's new website. Basically who owns it. And the money is directly connected to those that were funding Cruz. Some anti Trump rich donor that was supporting Cruz. 

You can go check him on twitter, and his own website(Mike Cernovich's danger play site) where he writes his stories. The story, pictures, links are there. 

I forget how much they funded his website where he "works" now. 

He got fired from Breitbart for contributing to that Michelle Hoax, and he basically got himself fire. So he could go be Anti-Trump for the $$$$$$$. 

Which is hilarious, since Shapiro was a huge Trump fan, and always said he could win. But he used the "hoax" as an ""excuse" to Turn on Trump. But Michelle Hoax was not it. It was the money. 

Mark Levin too. He is different. That Cruz Superpack basically directly bought hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of his book. Like a bulk order. And all of a sudden he is all Anti-Trump on his show. 

Mike Cernovich also looked into that. 

So one can take it as evidence. Or just normal "journalistic" pundit things. And pure coincidences. But thats how these pundits make their living really. 

But the money is huge in politics. Whole classes of people make their living as pundits, lobbyst, "journalist/bullshitters", lawyers, advisors etc. 

Its one reason they hate Trump(the political class). They all either been morons, or wrong. And its a bit embarrassing when you make your living as a "political expert" and when to "Harvard". 

Trump is a threat to the status quo of bullshit that our politics runs on. 
Holy shit I don't think the Trump train has blown anyone the fuck out as much and Benji. He's in worse shape than Jeb holy fuck how can he recover?
# Lol, one more tweet please.

# She said she'll date me if I stop Trump. lol
"The part will be fine. Trump can win the GE" LOL SAVAGE
Trump's candidacy has done more good for humanity in 11 months than any other president's full term 
/r/Sanders2Trump 
Lucky for Trump, /r/politics has been that subreddit for the past 10 months.
It will be more than 15% when Trump brings up in more detail; Email scandal, benghazi scandal, lybia, iraq, NAFTA, bill clinton rapes, hillary enabling. 
Why isn't Trump pushing these issues now? There are so many ways to bring down hrod and he's still bickering w/ Warren and Ryan.
And it will be a whole lot less when they see what Trump's policies are and realize they are nothing like Bernie's.
>Email scandal, benghazi scandal, lybia, iraq, NAFTA, bill clinton rapes, hillary enabling.

I don't think these things are news to anyone. 

If they support Hillary today they will continue to support her tomorrow. 

The ones the Don will woo over to his side will be the ones that are voting for Hillary because Donald Trump is *literally Hitler* -- you know even though they have no basis for their beliefs. 

They might learn about Donald and want to vote for him...
I agree with many people that any one of those scandals by themselves *might* be OK. Like we could look past it. But when you add all these things together you get a very clear picture of her character. I want Trump to be the interrogator. Bring up scandal after scandal. She can't possibly cackle for that long.
Exactly, I'm a millennial so Trump has the potential to be bad for me but the truth of the matter is we need to look at the big picture and Trump is the right choice for that even if he doesn't suit my short term desires.
As a young student who is currently attending a state run school, the problem is not the school. The problem is the parents and it starts usually before they hit college and then accelerates. Parents don't teach their kids how to think for themselves or that it is okay to think something that 99% of people disagree with. The majority of students I know are all for debate and free thought it's just that their reasoning skills are so out of whack that they can't see the forest for the trees. They usually come out of watching a debate thinking one person had clearly won when the opposite is true. Not saying that colleges don't have a role to play, just it is usually smaller then what people think.

Also, kids don't have a "sense" about people. It kills me how they all think $hillary is just a victim or is even a changed person now. And then they want to look at Trump and call him all the names in the book. Stupid

TLDR: Most kids don't have the reasoning and common sense to know what they are talking about or interpret data in a reasonable sense.
Very simple example:
Bernie bot #23453245: "Trump wants to build a wall that's rayyyciss!!! and would cost too much! He will never get mexico to pay!"

Trumptonian(me): "Well, Mexicans are a NATIONALITY not a race. And it's estimated to cost between 6-10 billion dollars(according to trump, who builds things for a living, and by estimates of similar walls constructed, aka Israel) , which is peanuts compared to ~85 billion they cost the tax payer every year. not to mention We GIVE mexico Billions of dollars every year in foreign aid, which we can just, ya know, not give to them because they send rapists and criminals across the boarder (and when i means send rapist and criminals, i mean just that, the government sends their trash this way to get it our of their country) along with those just wanting a better life. i have no problem with immigrants, but they need to come here "LEGALLY" and pay their fair share in taxes, assimilate into our culture and not just bring their culture and stay immersed in that (like how all these Mexicans go to trumps rallies waving the Mexican flag, hardly assimilated...).


I have found in RL anecdotally, when you are able to talk for an  extended period of time about a subject in depth, people pick up on that and see you as being 1) well informed 2) smart 3) persuadable 

When all you say is "trumps a rayciss!" and repeat it a million times, you haven't learned anything. when you confront these people and lay down fact after fact and there is only so many times they can say the exact same sentence before they realize they might be wrong.

Way more. Currently to Sanders supporters Trump sounds so Taboo, but he's a million times better than her 
They may have heard of it and know it but it isn't getting as much coverage and was some time ago. And chances are they don't visit this subreddit, so there are probably a good chunk of people who don't think about Hillary's flaws until Trump brings it up on TV. Not every voter browses the internet as much as we do, so those people will THEN realize how bad Crooked Hillary is.
Depends, there is a good chance that they will come after Trump mashes her like my mom's homemade mashed potatoes in the first debate.
Today probably, but by the time November gets here we would do well to have 15% of the burnouts.   The youth voter turnout is dismal in any case.   Turnout for 18-29 is usually between 20% to 30% in a presidential year, and even less than 20% in congressional only years.   Young voters have to be really invested in a candidate to show up.   Most will just stay home if they don't get what they want.   So 15% being pissed off enough to vote for Trump out of spite or because they modify their views enough to  actually agree with him is probably about right.    It is the 30% who just stay home that is going to be the killer.

Acording to RCP Sanders has received 9,426,517 votes so far in the primaries.   Assuming the numbers from above that means Trump could expect to get 1.4 million more votes and Hillary get 4.2 million less.  For a total swing of 5.6 million votes.  The difference between Romney and Obama was only 5 million votes in 2012.   That switch alone would be enough to put Trump in the oval office.   All of the other voter voter outreach, increased turnout for the GOP, and Democrats who have already crossed over and voted for Trump in the primaries is going to be just icing in the cake.
I'm predicting that Trump will actually manage to turn California red again.
I don't see that happening, the GOP out there is too badly outnumbered and too poorly organized to pull it off.   However it would be nice if Hillary had to dump millions into what should be a safe state in order to prevent it from happening.

New York on the other hand could be interesting.   Still a very blue state, but Trump proved in the primary that he could turn out a lot of non-traditional GOP voters.   Also for obvious reasons his "New York Style" of blunt speaking plays better to a home crowd then it will in San Francisco or Los Angeles.
I would believe that a negative campaign could work against Trump, if not for the fact that he's weathered multiple negative campaigns for months. Also, the negative ads that people typically run are really weak.
I don't think it will depress the others turnout.  Trump fires up his crowds like Obama. I think the more negative she gos the more it increases Trumps turn out. 


#It is MUCH bigger than 15% because of suppression and fear in social circles. Being a Closet Trump Supporter in 2016 is like being a closet gay Republican in 1985. The stigma is silencing. 

Trump constantly outperforms the polls because no one wants to be persecuted at work, no one wants to be yelled at in class, no one wants to lose street cred, and no one wants to have some belligerent asshole shitting all over their Facebook. 

Just yesterday I told my dad (who heads several offices) that coming out as a Trump supporter in public is the new gay. He laughed and said, *"I know. You're the first person I've told."*
Poor little cucks probably have a harder time coming out of the closet for Trump than us. Wah wah SUCK A DICK!
>Poor little cucks probably have a harder time coming out of the closet for Trump than us. Wah wah SUCK A DICK!

Being real, if I came out as a trump supporter I would lose my job, and people would probably vandalize my house and car. I love trump, but I'm not going to put my family in jeopardy to shitpost on facebook.

Idealism is nice, but reality doesn't always make it work. Coming out as a Trump supporter can destroy you in certain highly-liberal environments, and if it affects you to the degree that you can't support yourself or your family... is it worth it to speak out and be a martyr? 

I don't think it is. I don't think it's necessary.
People have lost their jobs for coming out as Trump supporters and have even been physically assaulted over it. You quite literally do not see that happening to other candidates' supporters. Like I said, the stigma is silencing. I love Trump but I'm not going to wear my hat in southern California...I have a wife and child.

It's really fucking sad when you realize that this is where we are. 
A group of illegals live next door to me, my house would get straight vandalized if I threw a Trump sign in the yard.
California resident, can't openly support Trump at work, can't put a bumper sticker on my car, won't put a yard sign on my lawn out of fear my house will be burned down. Yet we are the intolerant ones. 
Funny how this is commonly accepted, yet you never hear about other candidates' signs inciting property damage. Yet, Trump supporters are vilified as the violent ones.
I'm TrumpSexual. 

I'm officially coming out of the big closet, beautiful closet. We have the best closets, I may just go back in. 
I'm a gay white Trump supporter and man, I feel like a fucking Unicorn lol.
Can confirm. Closet Trump supporter currently under the "Bernie" umbrella in one of the most progressive cities in the PNW... There are many more. 
If this was an online poll, that isn't the major factor because people have nothing to fear. What will make that number go up is truth in the media going forward; People against Trump have heard very little about him and what they have heard has been misinformation. He is basically a Bernie Sanders with less empathy. He is a good person and that will come through the more people see of him.


I think Bernie may have been threatened by those in control to do and not do certain things or else lose what he loves. Otherwise it makes no sense for him to speak out against Trump and refuse to go for Hillary's throat when we know he is a good person who mostly agrees with Trump and has to know what a little terror Hillary has been acting like all her life and how easy it would be for him to win the primary for the greater good. But ultimately, people supporting the Bernie campaign have their own minds and will make their own decisions on election day based on all information received at that time. If it ends up being H versus T, I hope T will not hold back in exposing her true character nationally and nigh 100% of Sanders' supporters will vote Trump.
There are people who literally say "It doesn't matter if you're illegal or legal, he's gonna kick all the Latinos out! He wants to make America white again!!!"

Then they finish by screaming that Trump is a fear-mongerer, and laugh about "how dumb Trump supporters are."

The **irony**...it's like a top tier Simpsons episode...
Literally got yelled at when I mentioned that I would vote for Trump over Hillary, by someone who is, by all accounts a pretty racist individual. 
Combine that with the fact that most Bernie supporters haven't even begun paying actual attention to Trump.  Once he flexes his persuasion skills on them, I wouldn't be surprised to see 40% of Bern supporters go Trump in the general.  
I used to be in the closet about supporting Trump. Then the primaries came along and I became not so silent 
I agree completely. I'm slowly seeing more and more people voice their support for Trump. It's only a matter of time before we hit critical mass and it's not only acceptable to support Trump, it'll be considered "the American thing to do".

Trump has got this election on lock!

I think it's that the shock phase of "omg he said things about illegal mexicans and muslims" is coming to an end. I'd like to think people are starting to think critically about his claims beyond feelz.

Now that he is going to be the Republican nominee, it's a lot easier to voice your support when millions of others have shown their agreement with him in voting for him. Back when there were like 12 candidates, it was far too easy to say "If you're supporting Trump at this point you're an asshole." But since the people have spoken, it's easier now to stand by him because it's been narrowed down to just him and (probably) Hillary who is just not an option.
Even being the one person who won't speak badly of Trump or who says something Neutral on him goes a long way towards breaking that narrative! 

Notice how Trump won the last few states by 5-to-10% more than what the polls show...
As much as the whole cuck thing is a joke, he's literally willing to stand there and watch as Clinton gets the nomination because he's scared bashing Hillary will cause Trump to win because he's a NeverTrump.
Ah, well, that does explain it somewhat. But in theory he should believe that attacking her would help him beat her, and then if he doesn't think he can beat Trump why is he in it?
He'd rather have Trump have a better shot at losing than him winning.
# **Underestimation of the number of tickets needed for the Trump train if Bernie loses. Have 15 Florida voters who will be voting Trump if Bernie loses. I hear this train has no breaks???**
We are getting [extra cars ready](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OBcBbXOBT-Y/TQ5CelU7WwI/AAAAAAAABZw/7j80R18J474/s1600/140-4-right.jpg).   There will be plenty of seats on the Trump Express, nonstop service to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
I am NeverHillary and I WILL vote for Trump if she gets the nomination.
Yep definitely more than 15%. I can't even tell my democrat-voting family that are all voting Hillary anything positive about Trump without them getting angry. Same with people I know IRL since I live in a very liberal state/city.

But honestly I've always been a left-leaning democrat voter until lately. Despite initially being a Sanders supporter, Trump is truly the first republican politician that sounds great to me. And the leftist SJW movement combined with Hillary's bullshit had me thinking twice about where my views should -really- stand.
I question the word disavow there. Does it actually matter what their position is on Sanders if they're within the realm of preferring Trump over Clinton? It isn't a three way race in November. 

There are no fewer than a dozen ways in which someone could value issues in order to lead someone to voting "Sanders > Trump > Clinton". When they vote for Trump in November it isn't really them disavowing anything, it's just a willingness to vote for the best candidate on the ballot. As for how they feel outside their vote: do we care? 

Well I don't give a shit. As long as they look at the world and see who has it and who doesn't on the issues that actually matter. 
Yeah this is actually how I feel. When I come to this subreddit to express my support, I'm not disavowing Sanders or what he stands for at all. However, given that he isn't getting the nomination, and Hillary will never get my vote, Trump is the obvious choice. 

Still, the whole disavow thing is stupid imo. 
#**This is MASSIVE!**

If this holds true, then Trump wins the general election in a total landslide.  
I've been a Bernie supporter since early last summer when he first announced his run for candidacy. However, during these past 2-3 months that support has been waning immensely, it isn't because of the ole Bernster, but because of his supporters. The SJW Leftist movement has put me off ever wanting to have this version of The Left from taking over this country. The leftist supporters, the Anti-Trumps, causing a bunch of violence and spewing ignorance is so off-putting. I've slowly found myself leaning more and more Right by the day. Even a few friends that are very Left leaning I've slowly stopped talking to since whenever something new happens they go off on tirades of how "horrible, sexist, racist Trump is" and when I simply ask how is he racist/sexist/so horrible, just like I've seen on this subreddit, all they can do as a rebuttle is call me a racist and to fuck off. Very mature right? It's disgusting that this is the attitude a majority of people I know have these days, they're all about acceptance and progress and whatnot, but only when it suits them, if there's anyone with an opposing view whatsoever they just attack them with hate speech and cursing them out. What has happened to having a dialogue? 

I've took down all my Bernie bumper stickers, anything relating to him is gone, and has slowly been replaced by Trump support signs/stickers. This SJW movement is a plague that will destroy our wonderful country, it's time to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

I really hope Hillary gets the nomination so Trump will win by an insane landslide, indict her criminal traitorous self, and finally prove that we can do something to change this corrupt system.
I'm completely baffled by your line of thinking on this.

By this mentality, if all the batshit-crazy SJWs became Trump supporters, it'd reflect poorly on Trump and dissuade others. It's not up to any politician who stakes down in their camp.

It's like saying you've stopped supporting free soup kitchens because the people who are in favor of them are assholes. Well fuck 'em: Homeless people still need food.

Lend your support to leaders & concepts based on their virtues & quality of character, not the measure of idiots who follow them. :-/

Not that any of this matters anyhow since Bernie and Trump are the same person, but that's months out from coming to light, of course.
I don't think it's that puzzling.  It's not unlike when everyone freaked out that the KKK supported Trump.  His opponents presented it as proof that Trump was a racist, and as an argument that we shouldn't support him.  People do the same thing with Wall Street and Clinton, and with the evangelical flavor of the month candidate and whatever crazy preacher supports them.  Guilt by association is possibly one of the most predictable attacks on any candidate in any election.  It's not always a valid attack, but it shouldn't surprise anyone that people think this way.  They always do.
Yep, I was actually more in the "Bernie or Trump" category, thinking Bernie was misguided but his heart was in the right place, until Bernie came out and said white people don't know what it's like to be poor. Then he followed that up by attacking Hilary for at some point being against driver's licenses for illegals.

Now I know he's scum like the rest of them.
It's going to be really quite funny if Bernie supporters ironically are the deciding votes that lead to a Trump victory. 
It's much higher than 15%, I don't "support" Trump in public, because I'd lose my job, but he's got all my votes baby.
A comment in /r/politics pointed to a video of Cenk speculating about why Biden would be making all the comments he's made recently.

Not a fan of TYT, but he was saying that it's very coincidental how the FBI director came out and said it's an *investigation*, not a "security review", and then Biden makes a comment about how he'd have picked Warren as his VP.  

Given how Bernie is so anti-establishment, I'm sure his voter base has been somewhat polarized against Hillary.  I still am not super faithful they'd convert to Trump in any meaningful percentage though; more than likely they would end up staying home.
**I AM THE 15%**

I'm voting Trump no matter what in the general election. I love Bernie as a guy, he's truly respectable and a good person. But Trump ~~would~~ will be a better president.
Can't find the graphic... but there was FOX poll in Ohio (I think) that asked who Sanders Supporters would vote for excluding Sanders, and 40% said they'd support Trump over Hillary, 20% were undecided. Hillary was only getting about 25%.
It is in a Sander's supporters interest to vote for Trump.  If the DNC feels you will *fall in line* and support whatever shit nominee they pick after they marginalize and cheat you, they will **continue to do the same thing, election after election**


.  If they know you will fuck them over and hand them a **YUGZE LOSS** when they pull this shit, then....they won't do it.
Lest we forget 30% of the GOP said they were #NeverTrump and that number gets smaller by the day. 
Hillary is in a lose-lose position.

She either wins Bernie supporters by moving her agenda to the left and struggles to move to the centre ground, allowing Trump to scoop up moderates.

OR 

She moves to the centre and leaves a lot of Berniebots in resentment  for their 'message' not being implemented, allowing Trump to scoop up some of them with his anti-establishment narrative / they don't vote Clinton.
The only defense against Trump she has is calls him a sexist, racist, bigot, pig... which he can easily throw back at her when she attacks Bill's accusers.  Hillary is pretty good at defending rapists though, heck she married one. 
I used to be in the 30% that wouldn't vote for either Hillary or Trump but now I'm somewhat leaning towards voting Trump.
There are three factions of Bernie support: anti-establishment Democrats, Never Hillary and wacko socialist entitlement ultra liberal under 30 hippies. Trump will get a good portion of support from two of those three segments vs Hillary. When it's all said and done, maybe 30%.
I'm in that 15%. I'm surprised it's smaller. It always amazes me that my fellow bernie fans can bitch about the media being biased against him, then follow their garbage like it's law when it comes to Trump. 
Do we have any numbers on our side? How many Cruz supporters are #NeverTrump and how many will vote for him?
I'm one of the 15% that migrated to Trump. That statistic in not an exaggeration. 
I'm 33 and would vote for Sanders, but will definitely vote for Trump over Hillary, who should be in prison.  

I'm fairly open minded and I've read through https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions and if it's not all bullshit and heactually follows through... a lot of it sounds pretty God damned reasonable.

About his personality, I can be a brash person as well, but a lot of people like me.  I don't like people who I can't just speak my mind to and talk something out.  So what if he says shit that pisses people off who need to wear safety helmets to get through life... at least you figure out how they are real quick... 
CNN's exit polling found 34% of Bernie voters in West Virginia would vote for Donald Trump over Bernie Sanders if Bernie won the Democratic nomination.
Politics is bent, let's break it!
Trump!!!
So Hillary is going to...uh...win? the nomination.....does this mean Trump takes the whole shabangbang or what?
I have to vote Trump because my order of least evil went bernie overall, clinton over cruz, trump over clinton. I feel like trump is going to cause me to die in a nuke, but hes still better than hillary. A woman who gains responsibility due to marriage, will never be a good leader.
If they can manage to get Bernie the nomination, I'm cool with that too.

I believe that Trump would beat Sanders in a general election matchup as well. Sanders only has high poll numbers against him because nobody's running against Sanders at this point. Hillary and Trump are both running general election campaigns against one another, even if neither is (technically) their party's nominee yet.

And even if this was Bizarro World and Bernie won, that would **still** be preferable to having the Wicked Witch of the White House.
Sooo, in other words (assuming the Bernie supporters who're willing to vote Trump are included in the 45% statistic) 30% of Bernie supporters are #neverhillaryunlessitsgonnabetrump?
As a Bernie supporter, I can say with 100% certainty that I will never vote for Hillary, and will vote for Donald if it comes down to Trump v Clinton
Voted for Trump in the Republican NY Primary since I'm registered republican. I'm hoping to see Bernie in the general otherwise im voting trump. 

#fuckhillary
this is before they realize that Trump is a revolutionary too. There has been one revolution this election cycle, being fought on two fronts. But I think Trump and Sanders supporters should come together so the anti-establishment revolution forever changes our country.

I love Trump. He is a national hero. So is Sanders. But Trump already defeated the neoconservatives, so I will fully support him to demolish the Democrats
The more Trump is able to frame himself as an outsider that will disrupt a corrupt political order the more he will appeal to meta thinking Sanders supporters that want to strike a blow against the machine. This is why it is critical Trump maintain some strife and friction with the Republican establishment. 
I'm one of those 45%. Every time I see Trump talk about trade, I wonder how the Democrats don't set their hair on fire in fear. It's Hillary's biggest policy weakness and Trump's message on the topic can turn blue states red.

Besides, she's probably going to be under indictment by November.
For what it's worth, I'm an Aussie who's following this pretty closely.

Because our politics is your bitch.

I love Bernie and really hoped he'd get the nomination, but I'd rather see Trump in office than the lying Cunty McCuntface.
The amount of butt hurt a Trump presidency would bring is a once in a lifetime opportunity. SJWS, BLM, and every femanizi in the world would be triggered out of existence.  That's something I wholeheartedly endorse. Just I think you need a broader coalition is all.
If you support Bernie you are a cuck. That doesn't mean a cuck wants to stay a cuck forever. They can come over to the Trump side but they have to do so LEGALLY.
If Trump supported a single payer system to get rid of Obamacare he would beat Clinton in a landslide. It would pit corporate puppet Clinton against the American people. 
He does not have a plan to replace Obamacare and has not even described a system besides saying there would be competition among states. The plan doesn't check out though because you can't have a network in another state provide you a provider in their state. If Trump came out for single payer he'd show he's a true nationalist and what a corporate tool all the other republicans and democrats are for their taxpayer handout to insurance companies and drug companies with romoney-obamacare care. 
Trump and Bernie are somewhat similar but honestly I'm tired of money in politics, I don't dislike Hilary because she's a women, I dislike her because she's a symbol of greed she's always been swayed by money and power.  Trump has a very strong character that makes you want to believe him, Bernie makes you want to trust him through his past actions and foresight.
Realistically Democrats are more fractured than Republicans. Most major Republicans and Cruz supporters have already decided to back Trump or endorsed him. Regardless of how mad they are, Trump is still closer to what they want than Hillary.

There's way more bad blood between Sanders and Hillary supporters. Hillary has actively attempted to suppress Sanders's campaign, and there's countless cases of voter fraud (regardless of whether they're true or not). They're a lot more disenfranchised than you think. They've been campaigning against her corruption for months, many will not simply turn a blind eye.

If they're anti-establishment it's pretty likely they'll vote for Trump. A large portion of Sanders's supporters are young, many are first time voters. If they decided not to vote for Trump, or Hillary, that still hurts Hillary the most as it steals away from the RNC. She's going to need the votes.
Is this r/circlejerk ? I don't want bigot in office that will put all religions in one category like they did in Nazi Germany. Sanders may not be crooked and is probably best choice. But Trump is a joke under all conditions. He will cause horrific destruction of people as President. He has no experience and is an idiot on top of that.

But it would be stupid for there to be a gutter brawl in the democratic party that leads to Trump and his racist policy that is against all Muslims. It is pure stupidity. He reminds me of Hitler. I always wondered how Hitler was able to actually get the Germans to pick on Jews as a whole group. Now I understand. I see it with my own eyes.    
Surprise, surprise, it only took one comment to pull the Nazi card. Pathetic. 

Is Trump a bigot? No, wanting border control is neither racist, nor xenophobic. 

Is Trump an idiot? Definitely not.

Is Trump a joke? Nope, the joke's on you.
  
Is Trump against all Muslims? No again, he just wants a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants until ISIS is brought to heel.  

Is Crooked Hillary the very epitome of the entrenched, globalist, bought-and-paid for vacuous politician that every Bernie supporter is rallying against? YES! 

Does Hillary already have the blood of thousands on her hands? YES TIMES A THOUSAND! 

This is not 1932. This is not Nazi Germany. Trump will not dissolve Congress and declare himself supreme leader, and he will not massacre millions. People who think this is even remotely possible are the true idiots. 

Also, did you know his daughter Ivanka is Jewish?   

>  he just wants a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants

Why should all Muslims pay price for fanatics? That makes not sense. I have a 2nd cousin who is Sufi and should not have her rights in anyway affected by Militant fanatics. That is idiotic. 

I think Trump is not qualified for public office. He is a sexist and a bigot for sure. Anybody who can't see that is snowed. You can't ban ALL Muslims because of ISIS. They are not more Muslim than the KKK is Christian. The regular Christian should not suffer because KKK calls themself Christian. 


When did the Donald say Muslims who are citizens or have green cards will have their rights taken away? It is a complete distortion to say all Muslims will be banned by Trump. 

Sexist? I think not. Ivanka, not Don Jr., is the heir apparent to the Trump Organization. Ivanka is the golden child.

Then there was Carolyn, his right hand woman who appeared alongside him and George Ross on the Apprentice. From her wiki: 

"On graduation, in 1992 Kepcher secured a position as sales and marketing director of a golf club outside New York City. Her primary responsibility was to prepare the property for bank auction, where it was eventually sold to Donald Trump. Kepcher's ideas on how best to use the property impressed him, and he hired her as director of sales and marketing in 1994." 

That doesn't sound very sexist to me. I really wish Joan Rivers was still alive. She would put all that "Donald is sexist" bs to bed.  

You're really comparing the KKK to ISIS? One is a dwindling group of inbred morons who pose zero threat to national security, the other is a well funded and trained militant terror group who have admitted to using the refugee crisis to smuggle their ilk into Western countries. 

Again, nobody is talking about banning all Muslims except Donald haters who take everything he says out of context. 


 

> It is a complete distortion to say all Muslims will be banned by Trump.

I don't think anybody should be banned simply because they are Muslim. It is just the most "UN-AMERICAN" thing I have ever heard a politician say. It is obviously a bigoted policy and if you don't understand that you would have been a great Nazi. 

His bigoted ideas ( that are not even considered bigoted by his followers ) will surely be part of his foreign policy. 

>You're really comparing the KKK to ISIS? 

I am saying that KKK are not really Christians because in my eyes. And certainly I would not look at other Christians based on the actions of KKK who claim to be Christian. In the same way I don't consider ISIS Muslims and would not change attitude towards other Muslims because of ISIS activities. 

>Again, nobody is talking about banning all Muslims except Donald haters who take everything he says out of context.

Well I think you are simply cherry picking. If you treat any Muslim different because of ISIS that is bigotry and prejudice. But honestly I don't think a Trump supported can understand this - IF they did they would not support Trump.   

She's a corrupt politician.  Sanders and Trump aren't.
By comparison like 90-95% of Cruz/Kasich supporters will back Trump, though.
Don't need em.
Don't really want em.

Trump's momentum will continue to grow over the summer.....no one wants Hillary and there isn't enough money to pay off enough voters.

The train rolls  into D.C. 01/17
Trump and all his supporters are Neo Nazi trash that should be kicked the fuck out of the country.

That said, Clinton is worse. It's amateur evil vs professional evil. I'll take the idiot over the mastermind.
Oh no. I don't comment much on these things but c'mon. There can be no way in hell Trump to be elected. A liar is much better than Trump. Omg, I was about to say use common sense but, I agree, with Hillary it is hard. But cmon guys, no Trump. No Trump ever. 
**Math:**

Number of votes for each candidates thus far

* Trump: 10,924,682
* Clinton: 12,524,845
* Sanders: 9,426,517

Now give Clinton 55% of Sanders votes, and Trump 15% of Sanders votes. 

* Clinton: 17,709,429
* Trump: 12,339,109


What the fuck is the point of this?

How many story's have been written about supports of Cruz and Rubio supports vowing to never vote for Trump? 


This is a shit post just like all of /r/The_Donald

You left out Trump's votes from Cruz, Kasich, and Rubio. Idiotic cuck. 
Guy doesn't really sound too dumb if you ask me

Edit: TIL Trump supporters downvote opinions they disagree with. Huh, seems a little hypocritical. Assuming these are in fact his ideas, they are out-of-the-box and the market can decide if it will sell.  https://youtu.be/_O1hM-k3aUY?t=9
Those are all top posts on /r/cringe. Its not just Trump supporters disagreeing with you, its reddit as a collective. 
Haha. I feel like every celebrity who has made one of these statements only helps Trumps arguement. Wait, we can have Trump as president AND you leave the country. Win!
Another brain dead celebrity hack parrots the line de jour.

If I could stick out Bush and Obama this piece of shit can deal with Trump.
*hmmmm, I've been pretty irrelevant the past 10 years, what can I do to get people to like me and give me some attention......oh I know!*

"I will leave the country if Trump gets elected." 


*...ya, that'll do it!*
#ON ELECTION NIGHT 

I hope Trump trolls all these idiot celebrities making these claims.  Hopefully at least Rosie.
The reasons to vote for Trump just keep mounting up. 
Trump sets it, the London Muslims spike it.
Fuck the party. The party has been shit since Reagan (and Webb was part of that administration). Webb is a fucking war hero who left the Republicans because Bush was a retard and the Iraq War was a mistake. Trump is bigger than the party, and Trump needs to unite the country. The Republican party can't win that election, only uniting America can win it. So if some republicans whine about Reagan's Secretary of Navy not being a "true republican" then they can go fuck themselves
Weak pick.  Would appear to be total pandering.

It's basically Trump admitting he has a problem with hispanics and women at the same time.  
If Trump is serious about auditing the Fed then Rand is his best choice because the bankers won't be able to kill the Don and put a puppet in. It could save his life.
Trump is already splitting the party beyond measure, he's overturning the entire political stalemate we've been in for years. I think that Rand's libertarian conservativism that only focuses on issues that effect the bottom line is exactly the coherent set of principles people can rally around.

People like Mitt Romney, think the world would go to hell if just anybody could start a business. It's this unprincipled old GOP that created Obamacare in the first place, which has the end result of slowly turning healthcare over to a few large corporations.

We've tolerated the corruption in the GOP because it's relatively innocent when compared with the tactics of the progressives, but it had to give way eventually, we need to change everything, we need to start **WINNING** and not breaking even.
I think it's smart.  He was voted the favorite Republican candidate of democrats by far - and Trump is already siphoning much of the democratic voter base as is.

In terms of actual governance and knowledge of the constitution as well as the legislative process, who better than Rand?  He was the only voice in every debate who actually knew anything about anything, really.
Burn the GOP to the ground, fuck it. Webb would show independents and Dems who hate Hillary (most of them) that Trump isn't bound to party politics that's stagnated this country for over a decade. He's a pro-second amendment Democrat who served as Sec. Of the Navy under Reagan. Nobody could be a bigger "fuck you" pick to the establishment than Webb. Even Rand, who I love as a pick, is still a Republican and it just goes with what everyone expects. 
And tbh, Rand probably isn't on the shortlist. Rand would have to get behind Trump's agenda in a way that I think conflicts too much with his own, strongly held, beliefs. 
I don't think Rand necessarily disagrees with Trump's positions, but he would be reluctant to solve a problem in a way that he saw as expanding the government. 

He is not open borders and he does agree with restricting Muslim immigration -- Rand just thought that excluding people by religion was not a realistic strategy. But Rand did propose excluding people (or at least increasing the vetting) on the basis of national origin.
Trump needs a bulletproof vest and Rand is military-grade kevlar.
I don't think Ron Paul gets enough credit for what is going on here, with both Trump and Sanders. He helped mobilize tons of people and got a lot of people to feel like there is a chance to make a change with your vote.
Now he's pissed off that Trump is leading that charge. Sad.
I wouldn't be motivated about politics without Ron Paul. The man was frail, but knew how to rile up a crowd in solidarity. I also saw the exact same coming together of tons of different people from different walks of life as with Trump. These two men pull people together.
You said it. Ron Paul's 2012 push and subsequent dismissal by the GOP is exactly why Trump was able to come in and crush it this cycle. 
Paul paved the way, Trump slammed down the path with a fucking Humvee
If Rand is VP establishment would double the security Trump has.
If Trump wasn't in the GOPe race, he probably would've been my first choice, too. 
I was like "Rand Paul or no one". Then Trump came along. He had me at build the wall. 
LOL, poorly worded post on my behalf.

I'll keep up the charade, Trump's my daddy now!
Rand Paul has the closest foreign policy to Trump, and his regional balance of Kentucky would be good to Trump's NY. Rand has the most crossover and libertarian appeal. Newt has no crossover appeal, neither does Christie. Giuliani wouldn't be the best idea because of the double NY ticket. Rubio is establishment, and an assassination guarantee to Trump. I wouldn't mind Jeff Sessions, but he also has little crossover appeal. And Jim Webb is possibly the worst idea possible. You want to unify a party? That's not how you unify a party. Jim Webb's voting record is not at all representative of Trump's positions. You cannot base all of your info on a person off of one debate. Trump already attracts democrats and independents, and Webb brings little crossover appeal as is. Rand Paul is the MOST logical choice. The tricky part is wether or not he'd accept after his denouncement of Trump early on. As an early Rand fan, a Trump-Paul ticket would be my dream come true. 
I think a Trump/Paul ticket would be amazing. It may not be the best idea but I would vote that as many times as legally possible.

Trump said in that Michael and Kelly interview that he wouldn't pick Ivanka.. also I should have left in an "other" option, I thought this would only get like 30 votes 
Ivanka has been put in charge of running Trump's businesses while he's busy. I wonder why people keep bringing her up. She makes more sense for either 2020 or to run herself in 2024.
but Trump is not a libertarian
I think that's okay. They'd complement each other. And they're both on the same team in the globalist versus anti-globalist struggle, which is arguably a very important axis that has only surfaced out of the background in this election.

They come from different political traditions, it's true (hell, Trump wasn't even a politician a year ago). Rand is more cut from the libertarian cloth (although he's not a purist) and Trump I'm not sure what exactly you would call him. A champion of populist nationalism and maybe also a technocrat?

In my mind the fusion of these two movements -- libertarian idealism with a pragmatic eye towards nationalist policies -- is the only way for the GOP to remain relevant into the future. 

This would be a tent under which a lot of people would flock. People who want to see America be made great again, to act in its vital national interests, but also to start undoing the fiscal recklessness and the ballooning of the government that has occurred in the past few decades.

If we let the GOP continue to be run by globalists and neocons who don't care about America's national interests, or by the religious right, who prioritize social issues at the expense of the bigger picture, the GOP has no future.
so much this! Trump is the big fuck you to the establishment we need him to tear the mother fucker to the ground, but then we're left in ruins so we need a Paul to start building it back up on strong libertarian principles.
He is one of very few politicians that I honestly trust. Rand Paul is the man and if he's the VP I will not only vote for Trump, I will donate a lot of money and time to the effort, I like Rand that much. Trump has my vote but Rand has my heart.
Paul, Gingrich, Ernst, and Webb are probably the 4 best choices for VP.

The trick is to find the one with the best balance of public recognition, public acceptance, and policy. 

But, if Trump wanted to turn New York red, Guliani would all but guarantee it. 
And that will help him politically, or with some swing state. 
But Trump goes with his gut. If he is talking to some guy, and they dont get along, or that he connects/clicks better with somebody else, or that is more loyal, he will factor that in too. But he has 3 in there that would be good choices no matter what. 
I've heard Trump likes Rudy for Homeland Security. 
> But, if Trump wanted to turn New York red, Guliani would all but guarantee it.

Giuliani doesn't do much for me but the idea of flipping NY gets me rock hard. 
Trump is an offshoof of RP revolution. RP primed us for Trump. 
Jim Webb is a solid policy maker, or someone to run a department, but he isn't someone that really resonates with a lot of voters who aren't already on board the Trump train. Maybe you're right though, and he'd be appealing to independents. It's definitely possible.
Jim Webb is a solid dude with undeniable integrity and is a legit war hero. 

He's absolutely right and akin to Trump on foreign policy. 

He appeals to all the people not in Trump's base and would absolutely destroy Hillary's war record. 
Months ago a friend asked me who I thought would be a good pick for Trump's VP and I blurted out "Jim Webb" without even thinking. I was thoroughly laughed at, but the more consideration I give it the more sense it makes. I'm glad so many on Reddit see what I see there. Not saying he's my final pick, but Webb has a lot of merit behind him.
He's an incredibly strong pick for winning the election, and would also be great for bringing Congress to Trump's platform. 

A truly no-bullshit man to balance Trump's free-wheeling way of getting shit done. 

Also said he will not vote Clinton and would consider voting Trump. 
2 downvotes? Really guys? Here fam, have an upvote.

I don't know enough about Huntsman, but I would love to see Newt on Trump's team. If not VP, definitely an advisor. People are joking about VP choices, but this is serious business.
Read up on Huntsman. Out of everyone on that list, I feel like he's the only person who could really do anything to help Trump out.
Huntsman doesn't have much name recognition right now, but he is smart as fuck.  Deeply involved and knowledgeable on a technical level of a variety of policies and was our ambassador to China for a while (he was also a really strong ambassador).

His downside is that electorally he doesn't really offer much help in giving Trump another state he wouldn't already get.
But, then again, no one really does. I think the fact that he's a moderate, coupled with the fact that Obama chose him as an ambassador could help win over some moderate liberals that are on the fence about Trump. The name recognition doesn't mean much, as Trump has that in spades, but many/most VP's don't have a lot of name recognition to the general public until they're selected anyway. And, in 8 years after Trump has his two terms, Huntsman seems like he would be the best candidate to follow.
I can agree with you that name recognition doesn't matter in the end for VPs.  The media does essentially make them well known within a week or two anyways.

Policy wise I can see him being pretty sensible and pulling a lot more voters that Trump isn't already getting.  I'm sure the big thing he would be criticized on (assuming that he doesn't change one of his positions for the election) would be his stance on abortion.

I think in 8 years Huntsman would be a bit old for the Presidential election, but I guess it's not impossible.

Still, he doesn't really automatically deliver any states to Trump that would be key in the electoral college.  I'd put him as Secretary of State honestly if Trump wants to make China the forefront of his foreign trade policy and a part of his first 100 days.
Huntsman is 56 years old. In eight years, he'll be a decade younger than Trump is now.

Another benefit of Huntsman is the media loves him. A lot of conservatives hate him, but these are the same assholes who hated Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012 and who hate Trump now. Also, Huntsman is solid on God (Mormon, though), guns and babies. Never understood why he was called a RINO.
Trump picks Newt, Clinton picks Senator Bill Nelson. The Vice Presidential debate will take place on the International Space Station.
>Christie for Justice department. 

Fuck no. You want to expand the drug war, because that's how you expand the drug war.

Honestly I really don't think that fat fuck is in any way relevant to Trump, every time the dude has come up is for his failures. He's a neocon trying to fit in. I don't want him in any position where his ideology guides his actions, so any cabinet spot.
Condi would guarantee Trump's assassination; she's as neocon as they come.
[LOOK AT NEWT in 2012](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/11/17/newt-gingrichs-foreign-policy/) ! He was talking about the risks of radical muslims invading western countries all the way back in 2011. He APOLOGISED for being wrong about the importance of global warming. He opposed the Iran deal! He saw the anti-america trade alliances happening overseas, and I wager that today he is more supportive of the strong arm tariff tactics we've been relegated to as a last resort. 

>Gingrich is often referred to in the media as the intellectual of the GOP field

This is the PRO TRUMP intellectual political bulldog we need to round out a Trump presidency. He's not an insider anymore because he's been a vocal trump supporter for a very long time, yet he was SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. We've got Ryan on board now lol.

# You Can't Mute the Newt
Trump/ Mattis 2016

General "Mad dog" Mattis is somewhat of a god to Marines. Would follow that man through hell and back.
I stand with Rand... as VP. And if not then fuck him I'll support whoever Trump picks.
Rand is a perfect counter balance to Trump, he's pretty constitutionalist, and has connections in the House
#wow @ Rand commanding lead.  It wont happen though.  BUT if his dad Ron would endorse Trump then we can talk.....
Even if Rand Paul doesn't get the VP position, he should be worked into Trump's cabinet somehow.
Jeff Sessions is the only man I trust to carry out Trump's agenda if something were to happen to our Emperor.
Guys Rand is a very poor debater, Trump and his VP need to look phenomenal on the debates to give us some breathing room with Shillary. I liked Jim Webb
A Trump/Paul ticket as an honest to god realistic possibility of WINNING? I literally can't contain myself
Eh, I think there are just a lot of angry libertarians who jumped on the Trump train when they saw him not taking any donations during the primary season and how much the establishment hated him.

I know that's why I'm here.
honestly I think it'll be Scott brown, great communicator, clear debater, and serious Trump supporter 
I want to stand with Rand also. Please Trump, pick Rand!! And get Ron as Secretary of State!!

I'm glad Susana Martinez isn't on this list.  Really tired of hearing how Trump should pick her because she's latina and a woman.  I've yet to hear anyone discuss her actual policy positions.  If the best thing she brings to the ticket is checking boxes, she's not a good pick.
Trump's centipedes join forces with Rand's Band...That's what I love!!
I kind of like choosing Rand, he has appeal to independents and will crush any VP hillary chooses in a debate - especially if she pulls out a wild card and picks Bernie. 

There's also that safety net him being scarier to the establishment than Trump in office. 
He's a good choice and severely underrated here.  Anti-TPP, anti currency manipulation, delivers Ohio easily to allow Trump to spend time elsewhere, has midwest working class appeal to really drive turnout in the rust belt, and is a principled fiscal conservative that can get some of the skeptical hardline conservatives on board, lots of congressional experience.  
I like Rand... as I put in Sessions, since some of America would fear losing Trump if Sessions is behind him.
Rand Paul is my favorite senator but he wouldn't work well with Trump; he's better in the senate.

But Gingrich is the fucking man for the job. Nobody knows the Clinton's better than Gingrich.
My personal preference would definitely be Rand Paul, but Rand is unlikeable as fuck so for the sake of winning I really think Jim Webb would be the best choice.

His conservative supporters aren't going to jump ship now just because he picks a guy with a "D" next to his name.  Picking Webb would really fill out the populist/centrist ticket and would make it harder to Hillary to paint the Trump ticket as being too extreme.

Sadly I think he might end up picking Newt or Christie though.
How is he unlikeable, Trump already secured the older and establishment GOP vote. He just needs to take Sanders base and prevent it from going to Shillary.
I don't mind him personally but his delivery isn't the most polished and he't can often come off as snarky and sarcastic which turns a lot of people off.

And yes I agree but how is picking libertarian-ish Rand Paul for VP going to help bring young socialist leaning Bernie Sanders voters to Trump?
Voted Condi.

She'd not run, and Hill would certainly be screaming BU$H the whole time, but it would be great to see the libs tie themselves in knots trying to call Trump an evil racist misogynistic bigot with Condi on his ticket.
Exactly, stronger appeal to female and AA demos would be a godsend for Trump. 

Considering how much of Hillary's support is based on AAs and Women, as much as I dislike her ties to the Bush admin and being a neocon, she's well spoken and would certainly contrast very well against Hillary.

After all, any criticism of her Bush admin ties won't work given how complicit Clinton was with Bush's agenda, she of all people would know that. But she hasn't too my knowledge been very vocal as of late so I'd wager she probably isn't on the shortlist anyway.
But Obama wasn't a master wreckager like Trump is. 
It won't be Rand Paul. He wouldn't execute Trump's platform.
It needs to be someone as clean as possible. They're out to skewer Trump over any tiny infraction.
I would love for him to pick Webb as VP, but honestly, I trust Trump that he knows what he is doing. Whoever he picks, it will be the best decision.
I didn't see Susana Martinez on the list.  Republican, Female (Play the woman card), Hispanic.  I think that would help Trump with the *Legal* Hispanic vote and strengthen him in the west where lying Ted tried to steal delegates. 
Cathy McMorris Rodgers is a hell of a candidate...if we can get her to endorse Trump.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NJC8OQWFknI

http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/29/trump-should-pick-his-own-female-running-mate-cathy-mcmorris-rodgers/
Honestly, if Trump is going for crossover appeal and wants to silence the anti-Mexican/anti-woman narrative Susana Martinez would be a great choice. Additionally it might help him carry New Mexico, which he's currently projected to lose. Probably the most strategic pick on the board. 

Of course if he thinks that consolidating republican support is a bigger concern then Rand, or Newt would be great choices. Both are proven republicans who can speak very intelligently and eloquently about policy.

Ben! 

They've already tried digging up dirt on him to an insane degree. Integrity beyond reproach. Strong conservative, strong man of faith and brilliant guy.

Several Trump positions are things Ben has been talking about for years. Health Savings Accounts, for example. 

Trump/Carson is the ULTIMATE 'Odd Couple' - 'Bad cop/Good cop' ticket. 

This is my dream ticket. I don't think it will happen, but I still hold out hope. 
Can Trump choose more than one VP? Too many good choices.
Paul was my initial choice of candidate before Trump killed him, but, like Gingrich whom I also like, I'm not sure if it would mesh well.
of that list, it should be either Sessions or Rubio... both have a lot of respect in congress and can help Trump move legislation thru.
I may not be a big fan of the guy, but I think a Trump/Giuliani ticket could be yuuuuge.
I honestly think Rand will do more good in the Senate where he will have a more direct influence on legislation and Congress. VP doesn't have much legislative influence, and Trump will need friends in Congress to get anything done.
I prefer to not take any good Senators like Rubio, Cruz, and Rand out of congress. Someone needs to make bills for Trump to sign. 
Where is Kasich? I truly believe we will need him for Ohio to be safe. And picking him would go a long way to saying "i want to reunite the party under a Trump administration"
How about Kasich endorses Trump and secures Ohio that way? 
I'm a libertarian Republican, which had me probably not voting for Trump, and maybe voting for the LP candidate. 

However. 

If Rand gets picked as the VP, I'm now considering changing my vote to Trump. If only because that would pave the way to having Rand run for President in 2024. 

I dunno. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Susanna Martinez would be a great pick for a VP on the ticket. No one wants to agree with this pick because it seems they feel Trump picking a female and hispanic would be "pandering". I'm confused why its ok apparently to pander for the old farts vote with Newt Gingrich, or the Ohio vote with Kasich or the libertarian Reddit vote with Ron or Rand Paul, or the black vote with Ben Carson. Even though Susanna Martinez isn't perfect she has a lot to bring to a Trump ticket. She already shares Trump's view on immigration and securing the borders, has executive experience, and polls high with Dems and Republicans. She's well educated, competent, really smart and a far fucking better choice than that moron Sarah Palin but nope. Sell out! Pandering if he picks a minority woman. Pandering. The VP pick is all about pandering, no matterwho gets picked.
I eat my hat if Rand will be the VP. Trump wants a guy with great legislative experience, and someone who agrees with him on most things. Rand Paul fits neither of those criterias. 

It will be Gingrich.
I don't know if this was ever seriously considered or not but I feel like a Trump/Condy Rice ticket would pretty much guarantee a win in November, simply by virtue of her being a black woman. I really don't know shit about her but I'm still confident making that statement. 
She's been pretty vocal against Trump so that's why I didn't include her, also I just picked the most common candidates in the top comments 
If I knew this was going to get nearly the response it did, I would have changed a few things 
Giuliani and Rice were fully complicit in the 9/11 fuckjob including the subsequent wars and increased dismantling of our Constitution.  One of those two on the ticket would make me seriously question Trump's integrity and vision.
I was kinda thinking about Mass Gov. Charlie Baker. He's a great guy, young, another business man, and supports Trump. He also is not a conservative establishment cuckservative because he socially leans liberal. 
I love Baker, but he hates Trump. He does not support him. He's not young either. He turns 60 in November
If he wants to seize the votes it should be Sarah Palin.  Trump can play his own woman's card.
Why is Bernie Sanders not on this list? I feel like Bernie Sanders should be there. Trump/Sanders 2016-- death to the establishment.
I'm pretty excited about a Trump presidency, too...

I've decided to take a different route. I started using Facebook again just so I can shitpost Trump related memes. This sub has been a goldmine for content that's gotten my family, friends and even some co-workers all worked up. Finally found a good use for Facebook and I'm loving it.

Anon have you learned nothing from the teachings of Trump
At least it's still the primary, the US military folks can still have an opinion on Trump/Chillary right now.
I didn't realize Michael J Fox was a Trump supporter.
My body can't handle all of Trump's high energy. 
Hannipede will no doubt have a great interview with him, and hopefully Trump will have some good news about the meeting with Paul Ryan
They try to downplay it, but she's in poor health.  There were emails suggesting that she regularly needs a nap in order to get through the day.  Trump knows this and is going to physically wear her down with his high energy.  No breaks. No chances to regain her strength.  Just a constant stream of interviews, rallies and debates between now and November... if she makes it that long.
I'd bet Trump will be debating Biden or Jerry Brown by then. Hillary Clinton won't make it that far.
Its what happens to anyone who tries to stump the Trump. He publicly blows them the fuck out and rips them a new asshole on Twitter
It makes sense and it's a good strategy.  He doesn't need to worry about the individual state primaries anymore since the primaries are essentially over.  Now he needs to own the media and focus on being on the national eye.  Not only does this expose himself to people in earlier states who might not have voted Trump since there were more candidates and helps fix the NeverTrumpers, but it also shows how available and transparent he is as opposed to Hillary who "it's impossible to interview."  He is putting himself out there and making himself seem available to the people but it shows how unavailable Hillary is. 
Trump is making this look too god damn easy, ***NO BRAKES***
Serious question: Is Hillary in the public at all these days? Any interviews, campaign events?

Or is it just Trump roaming free? 
She's actually picked up her interviews recently from what I've seen, probably because she knows people are going to be wondering why Trump does 12 off the cuff interviews a week, and she does one every month and a half or so.  He's going to wear the hell out of her, hopefully to the point of giving her another stroke.
I posted this earlier and wondered why it didn't get stickied. Hannity is getting help from Trump. Be nice to Trump and he is 10 times as nice to you back. Attack him and he attacks 10 times harder. A true absolute Madman.
Yeah holy shit. Trump just calls people out. I fucking love this election. 
Hannity helps him too. Brings up talking points which he knows Trump likes, and backs up Trump wherever he can. 
Trump doesn't like losers, and Paul Ryan lost on a ticket as VP before..
Not in a million years.

He's already been on a loser of a ticket and Trump doesn't tie himself to losers like Ryan.
I'm sure it won't happen, but I think that is Paul Ryan's angle.   Paul Ryan as VP has become the secret hail mary of the GOP establishment.  They're telling Ryan to play hard to get, to negotiate for the VP spot.

Trump has stumped these cucks every other time, so I'm sure he'll stump them again.  But I think this is Ryan's angle.
I wonder if the author of [Liberality for All](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LiberalityForAll) will include Donald Trump as a character.
Boyscout Ryan and the GOPe want us to think they are the bearers of conservatism.  This interview shows beyond any doubt who the real conservative is - Donald Trump.  Time to gently remove your tampon, Paul Ryan and get behind the true leader of the Republican Party.
[MRW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3cNiGMYvCk&t=27s) all these traitorous globalists are trying to climb aboard the Trump Train.

Trump can make him bend the knee, or destroy his life ;)
Literally all Trump has to do is ask and Paul Ryan is out of his job
Trump will never sign TPP.  

Also Trump is a smart businessman, he won't sign anything without reading it.  I hope the days of passing shitty legislation filled with pork is behind us.  
I am pretty sure our current legislators have never read legislation either ([Fundraising is so time consuming I seldom read any bills I vote on. Like many of my colleagues, I don't know how the legislation will be implemented, or what it'll cost](http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Congressman-X/dp/1634139739)).  Also judging by our trade deals I don't think they know how to negotiate either.  That's the whole point of Trump.  

I know how Trump built his empire.  You sound upset about corrupt politicians, if only there was someone currently running that can't be bought because he is funding his own campaign. 


Now go back to Bernie.
I read a book called "Trump Style Negotiation" (or something similar) a while ago, written by one of his lawyers. The author claimed that once Trump had a good working relationship with him, he would trust the lawyer to negotiate and interpret contracts on his behalf, only asking if there was anything unusual he needed to know about.

This might be different when we're talking entirely new FTAs, instead of fairly standard real estate boilerplate, but there is a precedent for Trump delegating the legal finesse and triple-checking of documents to competent staff.
Ryan is garbage, no matter if he endorses Trump.

He is a die hard, Jack Kemp open borders shill.

It is in his blood and he will NEVER change.
Ryan backed Trump, that's fine. But we don't need another Paul Ryan. We don't need more RINOs.
as far as I'm concerned, until Ryan can endorse Trump, I shill for Nehlen

If Ryan does endorse Trump, we should push for a Nehlen v. Ryan debate like Nehlen requested and have them duke it out.  Ryan is a career politician and that kind of politician is cancer imo
> as far as I'm concerned, until Ryan can endorse Trump, I shill for Nehlen

Do it after his endorsement too. Ryan is a snake. Only reason he will get behind Trump is because he has no choice now. Wait till 2020 and this cuck will get behind establishment puppet again. 
I suspect when God Emperor wins, Ryan will be an "all about me" speaker of the house and give Trump a hard time on taxes, the wall, immigration (esp the terrorism preventions), probably even vets. He is Establishment - cannot be taken at his word as he has no honor.
Still back Nehlen.  I don't give a shit whether Ryan endorses Trump or not- in the end Ryan is still a putrid globalist.
If at the end of this, whatever it is, Ryan is NOT gonna support Trump, he's gotta go
One of the criticisms of Mittins when he was running was that he had flip-flopped on some key issues.  This will be confirmed when he swallows his hubris and supports Trump.  You're either on the Trump Train, or your last weeks garbage. 
Why is Romney even relevant still? I mean, how do you get upset because Trump is bringing new people to the party? Get this dickhole the fuck out my face already. Fuckin loser tryin to stay relevant. 
Prediction: Ryan will kneel before Trump, Trump will graciously refrain from stumping for Nehlen, and Nehlen will beat Ryan anyway on his own.
Republicans now fall into one of three distinct categories:

(A) Nationalists who backed Trump from the start (Arpaio, Hannity)

(B) Opportunists who want in on the new political order (Ryan, Kelly)

(C) Globalists who openly support Democrats (Romney, Krauthammer)
a benevolent leader contemplates both the transgressions of a person and the value they bring and chooses accordingly. Ryan was not "fuck you, Trump", but rather "hold me daddy, this is scary!". Let's not demand that Trump become Joffrey Baratheon, know what I mean? Ryan knows how to compromise, and that is IMPORTANT. Anyone who can't see the value in getting things done by compromise (negotiation!!) versus the fucking useless deadlock that comes from being unwilling to bend shouldn't have a hand in governing.
While I despise Ryan, Trump realizes we may need him to keep his position for rich Republican donors to counter Hillarys $2 billion push
Ryan cutting dead weight--good. Now best make sure he doesn't become dead weight himself and just do what Trump tells him to, or risk being fired. 
I don't think Trump will be a "perfect" president, but the positives definitely far outweigh the negatives (IMHO). That being said...McCain and Romney both lost...BADLY...so, why is anyone asking their advice?
I think I just realized what's going on. Paul Ryan is actually trying to become the Vice President for Trump.
I don't get the love for Azealia Banks on this sub. Yeah I know that she's a Trump supporter and all, but she is a huge racist cunt.

That being said, she should be able to speak her mind without having her ~~free speech~~ voice being silenced...especially when ISIS and other people who openly advocate for violence and murder on there are left alone.

Edit: For the few of you who are telling me that I'm misunderstanding free speech, I know what free speech is...I just didn't use the right phrase in my sentence. 
And who does that remind you of?

Seriously, fuck the people who are offended by her racist comments. They need to man up. This is exactly how the left is towards Trump's brash statements. Even though we know they aren't inherently racist. He speaks his mind and most of the stuff he says are true. That's what I love about the guy and I can respect Azelia for speaking her mind, even if I don't agree with everything.
I don't love her. I love watching the regressive left triggering itself. I never paid any attention to this clown in the slightest, but if she was some "kill all white men" racist nutjob, she must have been like the second coming of Mohammed to hordes of SJWs.

If I could have seen the looks on their disgustingly obese, flabby, ugly faces when she said she supported Trump, I could almost die happy before seeing President Trump Make America Great Again.

Which is exactly what is happening. And I dont think that people necessarily like her on this sub - but they are appreciative of any truth thrown out the for Trump, regardless of who says it.

I can agree with that. The problem I have is that people are saying that she should be banned simply because they don't want her being associated with Trump and his supporters. That to me is very liberal.
I think it's testament to Trump being a unifier. A person who held the beliefs you described above is on the Trump train. If that isn't reaching across the line I don't know what is.
Ehh I think it's more a testament to the people on this sub idolizing anyone who supports Trump. All the political subs do it but Azealia Banks is just a massive asshole that vies for attention by talking shit to everyone. She got banned for slinging racial slurs at the 1d dude. Not for being a Trump supporter. I wish we didn't pretend every little thing that happens is because people hate Trump. It makes us, and in turn, him look weak.  
She's been saying crazy/offensive things for how long now?  And she's gone viral for supporting Trump for how long? A week?  It's just peculiar timing on this account suspension.
You obviously dont know what youre talking about. She most certainly follows the race baiting narrative. Everything on her twitter is about how white people are the devil and black people gotta act a certain way. Shut up. Shes a Trump supporter, but shes fucking retarded 
I suspect liberals will finally care because it involves a black woman. Then again, she's supporting Trump so maybe not.
This is a joke, so she got suspended for writing pro-Trump tweets and yet she didn't get suspended when a few years ago she said that Palin should be gang-raped brutally? The latter sounds a lot more violent!

**Edit:** Correction, as many have pointed out: she was most likely NOT banned because of the pro-Trump tweets, but rather because of bullying of a 14-year-old. Either way she is fucked in the head and definitely not someone we would like in the Trump camp!
She got suspended for bullying a 14-year-old girl and calling Zayn a "sand n*gger" among other things. This has nothing to do with Trump or the "Freedom of Speech" card you guys are trying to pull.
Sorry, I didn't mean to say you specifically were doing so. But there are others in this thread implying that she was suspended solely because of her Trump tweets. And I agree that she has freedom of speech, but bullying does not fall under something that a company like Twitter should have to defend or tolerate.
She's the ultimate contrarian. I wouldn't be surprised if she's pro-Trump just because she knows a large portion of the people who know of her are young liberal black people who despise him. 
I don't care if she likes Trump. She seems like an asshole. 
say whatever you want until you endorse Trump. shits dumb
Guys, the banning had nothing to do with her supporting Trump. It was for some other racist shit she was saying about Indians. As an Indian, I just took what she said in stride cause she's a crazy cunt and it was kinda funny, but this has nothing to do with Trump. Still agree that it was nothing too egregious to warrant suspending her account.
Dorsey is a domestic enemy.  Trump should have him interrogated enhancedly.
Twitter is not a right.

The entitlement of some people amazes me.

I'm sorry you can't go back to telling politicians you don't agree with that they should be gang raped.

Just because she support Trump doesn't mean she's a decent person.

That kind of thinking gave us The Taliban.

And it's only going to get worse. When Trump builds a healthy lead in the polls against Crooked Hilary, the media will go for broke on the shilling as we approach Nov.
This is really why I think Trump's support is far greater than it seems. The silent majority is real and has grown to be bigger than ever, and the pendulum is now swinging the other way.
I was there, and yes we did. We did this for like a month for every one of their polls that mentioned Trump or Islam. 

For example: https://i.sli.mg/WmlvEw.png
Don't fret centipede.   


>Phone-based surveys in December by the Washington Post/ABC News, CBS News and NBC/Wall Street Journal found strong majorities — 57 to 60 percent — of Americans opposed to the proposal.

>At the same time, YouGov, operating online, found substantial and growing support for Trump’s proposal, with a plurality, 45-41, in support. When YouGov repeated the question on March 24-25 — just after the terrorist attacks in Brussels — support had grown to 51-40.

>This December-to-March shift was strongest among independent voters, who increased their support from 42-37 in favor of the ban to 62-37 in favor. Similarly, a March 29 Morning Consult online poll found majority support for the ban, 50-38, with voters who identified themselves as independents favoring Trump’s plan 49-36.

I feel like I can say this as a caucasian, we're stupid. We do things just because we think it's what other people want us to do. We do things just to feel good about ourselves. Oh my, look how unracist I am voting for Obama (because and only because he's black; yeah, not racist). Oh my, look how inclusive I am! Trump is going to free our minds and our tongues from the tyranny of political correctness. But what do I know, I'm a FUCKING WHITE MALE!
> John Boehner backs Donald Trump....

Isn't this a bit like thanking John Holmes for not sticking his dick in your ass.

John Boehner is a mess.
John Boehner is a terrible guy- he is no longer Speaker due to conservative pressure within the House.  I hope Trump ignores this guy.
The Tea Party was a heck a lot better than your typical establishment Republicans.  Now it has been co-opted by idiots like Ben Sasse, but the Tea Party base is more nationalistic and hostile to illegal immigration and terrorism and NAFTA/TPP than GOPe politicians would like.  If it weren't for the Tea Party, which helped the GOP win massive gains in 2010, then there probably wouldn't be enough enthusiasm in the base for someone like Trump.
Tea Party is definitely a big chunk of Trump's support. I was at the first Tea Party rally in my city - April 15, 2009. Lots of libertarians, funny signs that were the equivalent of shitposting. Happy warriors all. It was great.

Also Ted Cruz was not there, or at least not speaking, even though he was living in town at the time.
Nah, Bernie isn't based. Even if he threw his support behind Trump, it clearly wouldn't be an enthusiastic endorsement. Remember, this is the guy who scammed his supporters out of hundreds of millions of dollars as controlled opposition, would double the federal deficit in 8 years, open our borders to anyone, be a doormat militarily, got horrendously cucked at his own rally, and said white people don't know what it's like to be poor. He's delusional and a Bernie endorsement wouldn't elicit any response from me.
Trump has a Boehner. 
I hope Trump slows down or else November will just be a formality at this point
#Mr. Trump Please, Slow down, I can't take this much winning.
If Trump wins before the first Clinton/Trump debate I really will be sick of winning.
For sure Hillary Vs. Trump would be the popcorn matchup to watch, but at least Sanders would be an honest opponent.
A lot of polls have bernie with a much better matchup against trump yhan Hillary, which makes Hillary being the nomineee better for Trump.  On the other hand there has seemed to be no negative ads toward bernie and polls have been seemingly bullshit much of this election cycle.
Trump doesn't want to attack Bernie now because he can gather the bernouts after hrod wins the ass-race
Imagine if the Trump wrench wasn't thrown into this fray, it would have been an easy Hillary victory over Jeb Bush. Nobody was willing to attack with no holds barred until Trump showed up, Hillary would have played that woman card to the Presidency.
In all honesty, I would like to see a Hillary vs Trump general election, but not because I like Hillary.

Bernie and Trump are two very polarizing schools of thought which could potentially lead to a fairly evenly split vote in the general election. I firmly believe Trump would win, but I wouldn't discount the under-handed tactics of the DNC during the actual election. I would prefer as large a gap in votes as possible to eliminate the possibility of corruption in the system.

Hillary, on the other hand...

Trump would destroy her credibility as a leader with both hands tied behind his back, blindfolded, and wouldn't even break a sweat.

Hillary, in my opinion, would be the easy win.
Nope.  She won't bow out, she won't be kicked out either.  If anything, being indicted, she will stay in because it becomes her only path to a pardon (pardoning herself).  There is not law against running from prison, so there is no legal mechanism to remove her nomination.. and those delegates are bound by state law to vote for her now.  The dems are proper fucked right now.  It's fairly obvious at this point that Warren might get the tap for VP.  Which is why Trump is going after her and getting her to look like an unstable crazy mess.

Traditionally, I guess the nominee should hold off on these sorts of attacks, but fuck that, Trump is going pre-emptive on all his potential threats.  Trump's going to win in a landslide come November, there will be virtually no one left in the field to put up a fight.
They wouldn't dare, they saw how that worked with Trump, and we're the peaceful ones! There'd be riots and looting across the country, the likes of which we've never seen before. Trannies spitting in people's faces then crying victim, mexicans flipping cars and burning American flags then screaming oppression, it would be terrible. Makes for a good roof Korean market though.
She's getting backed into a corner by Trump, comrade Sanders and the FBI. Fucking hilarious
Never back a vicious animal into a corner; they'll go on a suicide attack even against an overwhelming opponent like Trump.

We should leave her a face-saving escape, like giving up for "health reasons" or "to spend more time with her family".
I honestly see no way of her being elected. Even if she makes it past the indictment, with Trump's skill and all of the information being spread on the internet, she has no chance. No election has had this much social media involvement.
You're making me realize how much more cringe this election would be if there was no trump. Other republicans would have worked early with hill to silence Bern early (aka Bernie would not have escaped Reddit, ala Ron Paul), and the pure bullshit from then on would go unscathed. Hell, this could be /r/the_cruz right now if we didn't have trump. So sure, thanks Trump.
> The only difference would be the republican in the race would never shut up about abortion and gay marriage.

Amen to that. A huge thing keeping me from joining any conservative movement ever is their incessant need to have regressive views on issues like this that immediately lose them all credibility on everything else (where they're usually correct).

Trump is one of the first credible politicians to have an agenda against political correctness and it's going to take him and us far.
Trump fuckin shut that shit down, the Republican Party is now wholly against illegal integration thanks to him and him alone.
If you can learn she PRINTED 52,000 emails and turned them over in a paper stack to deny investigators searchability, metadata, and BCCs and still vote for her you are not worthy of President Trump. She used dirty lawyers discovery tricks on our own government trying to drown them in paper. Only the guilty do that.
Too late, the media already crucified him. I love watching Trump demolish media. Now we need somebody to demolish BSPN too 
Yeah Tom should have gone Trump on the issue. And should call out of the media now saying "WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS YOU SAID YOU'D RELEASE? OH DO THEY BACK ME UP? THOUGHT SO"
I love to watch Trump take Hill apart in the General... But I've decided even more, I don't want her to have the distinction of the first female nominee for US President.  She simply doesn't deserve that honor and place in history.  And, anything to keep Ugly Chelsea from easily following her parents into politics.  We've gotta keep that junior version of Hillary from leveraging her parents' power and money as much as possible.  

When Trump finishes up his two terms in 2024, let's assume one of his kids will be next!  What could be better that Ivanka the first woman President?  Now that's a woman card! 

Do we have the best plan for MAGA!
Even better idea:

Trump runs with Oprah this year 2016-2024, then Oprah runs for president with Ivanka 2024-2032, then Ivanka runs with Eric/Donald Jr. 2032-2040
**WOW** They could back the US dollar with Trump's twitter feed, cuz that account is **GOLD**!!!
Several of the GOP candidates and other establishment figures did everything they could to knock down Trump. If he could be knocked down, I believe he would have been by now. I remain somewhat weary because the Clinton machine is not be underestimated, but I just don't see them stopping Trump even if they (Clintons) fully mechanize. To me it seems as though the Clintons out of touch with what is happening, but maybe they're playing coy until the real fight begins. 

That's just my assessment, I might be completely off base.

Edit: clarification
Hey Trump, how dare you criticize a woman!  Whenever you accuse one woman in particular of stealing thousands of top secret documents and then obstructing justice, you accuse all women of it!! /s
Trump stop winning!! I can't take it anymore!! 
Carson's ultimate revenge on Cruz is supporting Trump. 
Oh for sure.

Trump "hey carson, want to help me beat that rat that stole remote chance of a presidency from you?"

Carson "......................................................................6 weeks later 

Umm, well

Ya know the thing about 

Yes"
Clutch has been a band since the early '90s, haha. 

Anyways, keep on being a based Trump supporter and take it easy man.
Clutch (the band) actually formed in the early 90s, so they predate the term the way it's used on video games and on ESPN.

I would be stoked if the band loved Trump.
Carson was a damn good candidate, he just isn't built for the times.  He would have made a damn fine president. Truth be told I supported Carson first in this fiasco, but am proud to support Trump at this point and think he is actually better for the job at this point and time.  

I would like to see a Carson VP nod.  He is a good man that would provide balance and diverstiy to the ticket.
It says something about the media that we have a world renowned neurosurgeon and due to how media portray him that we "are surprised" about how smart he is. Trump is a self made billionaire who made his fortune in the cut throat NY real estate market, where a ton of really smart guys from all over the world go to have their dreams die, yet the media is surprised trump can string two sentences together. Stupid media.
Trump is a munchkin build. 
Carson is learning a thing or 2 from Trump
> I lost it for him when it turned out he didn't know much on foreign affairs.

Explain your basis for that. The only thing I ever noticed is that people didn't ask him foreign affairs questions. I heard him give a number of speeches which seemed fine. Also, the one question he did answer (after practically begging them to ask a question on foreign affairs) he said (paraphrasing), "People up here are talking as if they are experts, but they aren't. You have to collaborate with your generals and people in positions because they are going to have direct access to information," around that time he was cut off. Had he not been cut of, based on his other speeches I've heard, he would have then described the collaborations he's had with generals.

This, "He doesn't know foreign affairs" was an intentional hit piece. He actually does, but if people knew that, he'd have lost his last negative.

I actually started focusing on Trump once I realized the extent (and make no mistake, it was intentional) the media had gone to in order to portray a narrative that he was just a kindly, well loved old doctor. They were intentionally sending him softball and irrelevant questions. So you'd leave the debate with images of the other people speaking about international affairs and him not.

This image was intentional. It was also what made me sit up and take notice of the image that Trump was being portrayed with by the media.

Carson is not at Trump's level, but if Trump wasn't running, Carson was the most knowledgeable of the remaining 16. He doesn't have the temperament, nor rapid-fire type speaking gymnastics, to win in a mud slinging election cycle, but he's got the knowledge and wisdom to be a sage and valuable advisor on almost any front.
Hell, most presidents may be able to recite things about the economy, military, and international interests, but they have know idea about what decisions should be made. The President is essentially just a figure head who is supposed to listen to the experts he hires. No President can be an expert economist, an expert negotiator, an expert military tactician, etc. They are expected to put people in the right places and listen to their input. But this is why Obama is such a bad President. He has shown to not give a shit about what the experts are telling him and just wants to do things his own uneducated way. Obama won't even listen to military generals when it comes to military strategy. The best thing about Trump is not only does he hire the best people for the job, but he listens to their input. They are experts in their field for a reason and their input should always be seriously considered.
Does he know any less than Trump?
I don't know. But Trump said "let's be friends with Russia" and that was enough for me. Carson was your typical "cut Putin off at the knees" type. Iraq, Libya, and Syria have all be disastrous failures for the US, and Trump seems to be really the most intent on changing course.

Hell even Bernie Sanders' foreign policy was basically "let the Saudis take care of the middle east." Trump's stance on that issue is "fuck the Saudis." So I will say, yes, to me, Trump's foreign policy statements have made him truly the only candidate talking any kind of sense.
The job as President boils down to making good decisions based on the information at hand. Both he and Trump are more than qualified to do that (though Trump is definitely more worldly, and a better "people person")
This exact reason is why I initially supported Carson, and then Trump. 

Voted for Trump in mass primaries, because I realized Carson couldn't win big.

So glad to see him still around being based as fuck
Yup, and that is the beauty of a Trump presidency. He isn't the dogmatic politician with a vague ideology he is trying to push. He can find a bunch of smart guys to actually do productive shit instead of pandering to people's bullshit.
 I didn't think he should be president.

 But I give him a lot of credit for staying true to himself, having the resolve to face inevitable Uncle Tom bull shit from liberals, and for weathering so-called "conservatives" from his own party knifing him - after he wouldn't drop out on their schedule, and then after he endorsed Trump, many smeared him as just entering the race for money and book deals.

Very intelligent, crazy good at math, but the other three literally invented things that it would have taken centuries for multiple other people to figure out. 

Einstein was crazy good, but many other scientists of equal importance were alive at the time working on the same things, like J. Oppenheimer on nuclear fission for example. 

Newton had to *invent* his own form of calculus to discover and explain his own work. 

Leonardo is, to this day, considered the most widely skilled person to ever live and excelled at so many things that he did its impossible to not consider him a genius beyond most could ever compare. 

And Mozart, while apparently crazy immature created unparalleled music and for centuries people have been trying to emulate his skill in what I see as the combination of science and art; music. 



If you'd have me rank out the top ten most brilliant humans to ever live: 

- * Kim Ung-Yong - I would rate as #1 if I believed what is claimed, but there's very little evidence he was actually that smart. And has accomplished essentially nothing for humanity, despite his claims. 

    10. Benjamin Franklin

    9. Albert Einstein

    8. Hypatia

    7. Otto Von Bismark

    6. Aristotle

    5. Nikola Tesla

    4. Sir Isaac Newton

    3. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

    2. Leonardo Da Vinci

    1. Donald Trump
What are your arguments for Trump being rated as the most brilliant person that ever lived? Not trying to be a dick, just curious why you would rate him #1 over everyone that ever lived.

Well to be fair that is actually true. Instead of an echo chamber there should be debate, there **SHOULDN'T** be arguing. That's why people are voting for Trump now, because they were denied the right to debate, to debate why Blacks commit more murders, to debate why illegal immigrants commit more crimes, to debate why should the illegal immigrants get aid from the nation they went into without being called "racist"



If you disagree with Liberals you're labeled a racist and bigot, people are sick of this, people want to understand and to understand you must debate, you mustn't repeat the same thing over and over again hoping it will become true; shutting down every argument no matter how legitimate it is because it goes against your agenda.
I'm pretty sure this subreddit is meant to be an echo chamber just to give some balance to the other ones.At the end of the day some truth is found in every single one, all-be-it distorted and taken out of context to fit the narrative of each one.


At the end of the day your opinion should be constructed by yourself, not by others. You should be the one doing research for yourself.



I for one support Trump, not because of this subreddit, not because of the liberals but because I searched for the answer myself and found out I agree with most of his policies and I believe that him as a president would prosper my country and the international community.


I can't recall where I heard this but someone once said: "Your opinion should not define you, your opinions should be swapped if a better one would come along"



edit: long story short I come here to shitpost and meme 
And this is why I never understand why people are anti-Jedi. They point out every infraction of the Jedi code and say that we should do what? Kick them out? Kill them?

People fall short of codes of conduct. Most codes are inspirational.  Most branches of the military have a code of conduct, or leadership traits. Are you going to kick out some Pvt because he got trashed and threw up at the strip club? No, because then you wouldn't have an effective military. 

On another note, people seem to choose who to vote for based on their demeanor. Sanders? Cant vote for him, he's a grumpy grandpa. Can't Vote for Hillary because she is shrill. Can't vote for Trump because hes braggadocios.

Here is the short list of voting criteria

* What is their stated agenda

* What do you believe is their actual agenda

* What is their ability to achieve their agenda

Personality only really impacts the 3rd bullet insomuch as it impacts their ability to build and lead a team.
 
To reiterate my main point, poor communities pay taxes too so they are already paying for those things. Also, you are working under the assumption that even in poor communities, if government didn't build roads/parks/whatever example, then no one would. To give an appropriate example for this sub, Donald Trump stepped in and renovated and improved [Wollman Rink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollman_Rink) when the government was dragging their feet.

>otherwise protected lands could be purchased and lost forever

If it is important to people to maintain some protected land, then those people would help donate to make that happen. I know I would. 
Yes, we donate to the government through taxes, and they handle it for us.  The government is good for some things, where there is common interest.

Poor communities pay far, far less taxes than rich ones because anyone making under a minimum threshold (which is much higher with a family with kids) doesn't pay any taxes.  Donald Trump only stepped in for the Wollman Rink because it was right next door to his tower in Central Park.  That is not a poor community at all!

If the government doesn't protect the land, and a company has owned it - all it takes is one guy to mismanage the company and poof, it's gone.  That kind of survival of the fittest is fine when its investors money on the line, but it's not fine when it's our beaches.  Apathy also comes in waves, and I would hate for apathy or economic hardship to cause people to have to choose between national parks and food on their table, because they'll choose the food and the national parks will be gone.
I'm pretty much a libertarian, yes, and I already do subscribe. Was originally a Rand Paul guy before I jumped on the Trump train. 
I think some people in here don't actually know why the quote is clever. Or, I guess maybe I am.

I don't think Carson is making a jab at Ryan, if anything I think he's making a point about how productive such a meeting can be. Trump and Ryan *don't* see eye-to-eye on things so it makes sense for them to sit down and talk things out.

I don't think it's a jab at the media.

If anything I think it's more of a jab in line with other top comments are indicating -- towards the idea of safe spaces and things like that. If you are only willing to sit down with people you agree with then you'll never learn anything new, grow, or help mend fences. You'll always be in your own little bubble. You're safe from dissenting opinions, but 10 people agreeing on everything only really has the thought value of 1.
I hope Trump VP's Ben. What if Trump's "political experience" thing about choosing a VP is just a diversion to cause even more media stir?

\>Muslim terrorist take over a dc-area elementary school

\>Trump personally rushes in with just a flak jacket, m-16, and five secret service agents

\>Carson, a minute behind, gets out of his 88 GTO brandishing is.45

\>"I'm getting too old for this shit"
> Trump personally rushes in with just a flak jacket, m-16, and five secret service agents

I'd imagine that three of the secret service agents would have to be Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Vince McMahon.
Goddamit Trump better have a place for Carson.
This is why all those establishment drones mock Trump's anti-waste/fraud/abuse stance.
Trump picked a very good guy in Carson. How can the black voters prefer Hillary and the PC plantation inherited from Obama, to Carson, freedom and jobs.
Ben's truly a great American. I genuinely feel sorry for people who judge him solely on his religious beliefs, speaking style, the fact that he's conservative or some of his personal pet theories. 

He's arguably the most famous BRAIN SURGEON who ever lived. He doesn't apologize for his advocacy against PC culture or for his unwavering social and political principles. All this in the face of extraordinary scrutiny, mockery and attempts at character assassination. 

Ben was my first choice this cycle, by a mile. I totally trust him when he says he prayerfully and pragmatically endorsed Trump. He knows him much better than any of us do. And I say this as (though I dislike labels for this type of thing) an 'Evangelical.' 

Ben is the opposite of Cruz, who espoused Christian values but flagrantly ignored them in his own campaign at every turn. I don't claim to know what's really in Ted's heart, but his actions speak pretty clearly, IMO. 

Our nation would be lucky and blessed to have someone of Dr. Carson's caliber advising and/or serving in the White House. 
Carson originally had my vote but since he endorsed Trump, I'm trump also

If he doesn't use him as a VP, a huge potential and essential American citizen is wasted 
The reason people might not think he would be the best fit for Trump's VP is because, like Trump, he has very little political experience.  I'm sure Trump has a place for Carson in his administration though. 
Well I guess Bruce decided he doesn't want to be a tranny anymore so I suppose that's right.  They disowned him the second he came out for Trump regardless.

Wait, hold up! Why are you supporting Trump??? Are you not aware that it is [$currentyear] and Hillary possesses the holy vagina of female solidarity?

I feel like Ivanka may be one of Trump's biggest assets this election (her assets aren't too bad either). 
Who'd have thought America would revert back to a hereditary monarchy in 2024 as the Trumps are crowned.
Honestly this sub should want nothing to do with this crazy bitch. I support Trump 100% but seriously this bitch is the devil. She just happens to support Trump.
NOTE: A few weeks ago Banks, sent out really nasty tweets about Sarah Palin getting black dicks all up in and around her. It was HIGHLY publicized. No suspension there. But now that she comes out as a Trump supporter...suddenly Twitter finds her tweets too offensive.
Exactly.  And this is why Trump is winning; real Americans are sick of this shit.
Let's be honest.

The Banks person is a fucking nut. Why should this sub even give a shit that she supports Trump? Who fucking cares. From the little I've read from her, she's all over the map and reeks of some sort of serious mental disorder.

She's meaningless.
For real. I understand that having more Trump supporters in the public eye is a good thing, but Banks seriously has schizophrenia or some undiagnosed issue. She was hot in the music industry for a minute with "212" but she tarnished her career with social media shit talking to the point where that is all she is really known for now.
This forum puts every black/asian/latino/gay who supports Trump on a pedestal.
Kind of necessary to showcase minority support when the "Trump is Racist" meme is the Democratic Party's campaign platform.
The alternative is not responding to the attack.

Trump is doing his best to change the conversation to jobs and borders, but to think you can just ignore the allegation of "racism," is naive.

The more minority support Trump has, especially in front of the media, the more the Democrat meme loses its power.  Considering that's all they have, I hope they continue.
You know it's funny, they keep telling us that we are losing because of this or that. But in reality, Mr. Trump keeps winning. And so, we keep winning. You do see all the winnings, right?
Perfect timing too, seeing how she recently went on a racist rant on some artist that [she claimed was stealing from her](http://puu.sh/oPxwh/a26b8a296d.jpg). When he snubbed her as a response she went on said rant, calling him a bitch nigga, a hairy curry scented bitch, called his mother a dirty refugee who won't be granted asylum, a sand nigger, etc. After she was dropped from Rinse's Born & Bred festival because they didn't support her racism.

Then she went after a 14-year-old girl from Disney, telling her to grow some hips and start her "menses". 

I wouldn't be surprised if they found any excuse to grab at to suspend her for her Trump support and redpilling on Hillary. Seeing how they decided to suspend her after she came out as a Trump supporter, but not when she told a pack of black people to rape Sarah Palin nor when she talked shit to a bunch of other celebrities.

nope, read the Twitter feed yourself. That's like saying Trump got destroyed by Rubio because nationalreviewtwitter said so.
I think she was temporarily banned for using racial slur on another artist.  Not supporting Trump

Please dont spread false info and make us look like idiots
No she said some nasty ass shit about some guy in UK.  She used words like n****r.  Days after she came out in support of Trump
He called lame Zayne, ex-1D loser, a sandn***r. That his music is lame. The SJW's went haywire not from this, but that she said she supported Trump.
Yes.  The twitter ban wasnt probably for calling him a sandn***r, and probably worse since those tweets don't interest me

Edit: I have no doubt they would hesitate to ban her if she wasnt a Trump supporter
Of course - but those reports went in because of her political views -  where there were ignored before - no one cared or reported them before she came out in support of Trump

Then some human reviews those reports - she had a verified account after all - and that person made a decision to enforce where they were ignored before.

It's obviously motivated by an anti-trump contingent. Look at the new unverified account - the anti-trump group are already saying they are reporting that one.
Yes, I just confirmed it. https://twitter.com/AZEALIABANKS

This needs a sticky. They are trying to suppress black supporters of Trump.
They could pick out one tweet from 50% of the userbase to ban them. The only reason they actually did was because she was black, female, and an influential Trump supporter and they don't like that narrative.
Thing is Trump attracts all sorts of people. Some of them are going to be whiny bitch ass cucks like OP, it is what it is. 
For real. If you want to MAGA with Trump, I could care less if you are a racist asshole. We agree to disagree. That's how it should be in not only America, but the internet as well. People being butt hurt need to move on.
Yeah but she's very high profile and has consistently done stuff like this over the years, maybe her support of Trump played a factor in the ban maybe it didn't, but regardless to be real she isn't someone we want on our side let alone representing our argument to millions of twitter followers or however many she had. 
This is absolutely the reason why. Honestly, people should be glad she was suspended. She was casting herself, a public supporter of Donald Trump, in a negative light. 
Don't be desperate for Trump support people. This bitch is an unhinged asshole and a huge liability for Trump.
Ehh, probably less to do with Trump, and more to do with the other stuff she was tweeting.  TBH, it's probably best for Trump that she got shut down.  This isn't the sort of person who brings in more votes; she just serves as an example of "one of those dumb Trump supporters."

If we wanna MAGA, sometimes people bringing the moment down will have to BTFO.
It has nothing to do with her Trump support. I disavow Banks
And the funny thing is, I bet they assume that Trump supporters would not care because of her other views.  Well, news flash, we do not think people who hold opposing views should be censored even if we disagree with those views.  That is something foreign to the left.
You know the articles that say that more people will vote for Trump but are afraid to admit it? This is why. Support Trump and you are ostracized. 
This is crazy true from what I've experienced. I speak freely about agreeing with Trump only with those I know also agree. After the third good friend tore me up I just couldn't take it anymore. Every one of them is aware of my extreme distaste for the crooked cunt, though, and know full well when she gets the official nod from the dnc they can all eat a dick if they even mention that my duty is to her in any way whatsoever. 
Why do people keep giving this dumb cunt attention? She is not a Trump support, if you think this you're a fucking fool. Everything she does is for attention. She says she supports Trump but I highly doubt it. She again did it for attention. Stop being fool by a dumb cunt guys.
Well yeah, if a highly publicized figure is constantly spewing vitriol, at kids or otherwise, it kinda makes sense for them to be banned. Timmy Trichromy calls his friend a faggot on twitter and no one is going to bat an eye because who in the fuck cares about him? Following her constant stream of mind-numbingly stupid actions and statements on HHH has been horrendous, I'd want absolutely nothing to do with her if I was Trump, and as a supporter I want to distance myself as far as possible from her. She's an untalented imbecile who let a hit or two inflate her ego to planetary levels.
I think it's because she got in a fight with a 14 year old and was really explicit in her language. 

Either way, I support that she supports Trump. Trump supporters come from all walks of life and aren't afraid to be honest. Unfortunately, she's honest about how crazy she is lmao 
Didn't this have something to do with that 1 direction guy? She recently got kicked off a festival line up for being really racist towards him so maybe that's why, not Trump
You realize that this cuck said that she wanted Trump to win because he is evil just like America right?
She is a foul mouthed based bitch who has insulted everyone at one point or another. Her bans are not because of Trump support, racism, or anything else. She did what no one wants any black people to do, have an opinion that violates the DNC monolith, and she threatened their Twitter safe space. 
No, she was suspended because of the obscene comments she made that gained a lot of traction and targeted multiple people. I don't think her being a Trump support had much to do with it. Stop making up things for the sake of upvotes.
On my death bed I hope to be mailing in my early vote for God-Emperor Trump's 15th term

Doing an image search of Clinton and Trump it appears that Google is scrubbing bad pictures of Hillary. You really need to dig for them. For Trump they are right there on top. 
This is going viral on Facebook and Twitter right now!

#HillaryClinton
#CantStumpTheTrump

and Trump had the most outside spending against him too.
I love how all the cucks are always crying about how "Trump plays the media to get free exposure wah wah."

What does that say about the other candidates?  There's really only two answers: they would rather just spend a shit ton of corporate and poor college kids' money or they just plain suck at getting media exposure.
So they're saying Trump ran a campaign and got the media to pay for it? Sounds familiar...

Also, Trump does so many interviews and rallies while the other candidates don't accept even when they're offered.
> essentially buying their way to the presidency?

I mean, the point is these people are outspending Trump and unable to buy the presidency.  Soros could throw a billion down and lose.  To state Trump is buying the presidency is disingenuous at best.

I do agree people have the right to support Bernie, but at this point it really is delusional to give his campaign more.  Still their right, but still delusional.
Trump's primary oppoents combined had I think over half a billion dollars.
It's fun to watch people's reaction after hearing Trump answer things in detail.  Their perception of him has been so heavily distorted by the media.  It's why he keeps gaining support, people give him a real chance and take a closer look.
Hey guys!  I just donated $0.00 to Trump's campaign so he can make America great again!

He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
#THIS IS WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT TRUMP.#

I've been saying this for months now to friends and family that what I love most about Trump is he is UNAPOLOGETICLY himself. He doesn't apologize for trying to pay as little as he can. It's such a breath of fresh fucking air.  
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4j5xrh/donald_trump_denies_washington_post_audio_full/
They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxaKUo5naoY

Or show you this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCHZbB-M9oE

**Our media are our enemy now. Most of it is garbage. And most of them are liberal marxist globalist snake pieces of shit. Not journalist anymore. But professional race baiters, bullshitters, and manipulators.** 
Before the end of my life I must make a pilgrimage to Trump Tower and partake in the World's Greatest Taco Bowls.

#TRUMP TACO BOWL > JEB! GUAC BOWLE
Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.  

**Trump steel won't bend or break.**
#MAGA
Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.
Pretty sure this is gonna end up on a Can't Stump The Trump video
Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
How embarrassing. You can hear the desperation in his voice trying to nail Trump on his tax returns and then actually trying to defend Hillary for her missing emails.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Trump is fearless.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.
[watch the short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Y7cA8w6Hk)

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
Personally I think Trump could get as much as 60% of the black vote.

This would be absolutely devastating to Hillary for every black person were vote for Trump
No, even in this poll [Clinton is up by 2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/Gravis_National_Trump_Clinton_May_2016.pdf) I don't know where they got this split from, but I can't imagine it's right. In what universe does the Democratic candidate lose the hispanic vote and still win overall?
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs. 
Mccain got 3, Romney gets 7, Trump gets 13. 
That will help Trump's push into the rust belt and northeast. Romney list every damn state North and East of Kentucky
#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.
Status:

Libtards: Stumped

Bernie Bots: Cucked

Clinton Shills: Crooked

Brakes: Failed

Trump Train: Ahead of Schedule
Trump: Ascended God
I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
Well the guy on the right is wearing a Trump shirt... #trigger

Does the middle guy's shirt say Zodiac?? Can't read it.
Cucks were trembling in anger, but our Trump team covered the entire school in posters and Trump chalk. 
That's Donald Trump

I don't know what would trigger liberal feminist cucks more, the photos of trump or the 3 clean cut, good looking FUCKING WHITE MALES doing the Trumping.  
Someone is doing the Trumping
I actually voted for Donald Trump in the March Primary. At this time in high school the majority of students are 18. 
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
Trump should retweet it.
"Worst mistake"? Nobody on Hillary's twitter is going to read this positively.

In it's excitement, this sub has lost it's mind a bit. Just another flavor of sanders for president now.

Good luck to Trump, really hope he wins, I'm done with reddit for a long time.
She also said she wouldn't lose to our Lord and savior Trump
Trump Tower has the best quota dip!!
#We get both Rocky and Rambo on the Trump Train for the price of one!
Don't forget Marion Cobretti, Judge Dread, and Tango... or Cash... I can never remember who was who in that one. I just hope Kurt Russell is for Trump too so it won't matter. 
Crime is the disease. Trump is the cure.
Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character. One of them takes a nuanced approach and pokes fun at himself during it, while the other gets on a soapbox about refugees. I guarantee none of those refugees will be anywhere near his mountainside mansion in Italy.  
> Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character.

"We will not be governed by fear" said the nervous man failing to form coherent sentences while he attempts to create mass hysteria over patriotism.
As they do nothing but try to make people fearful of a Trump presidency.  They are everything that they rail against.  
For having made a career glorifying gun violence, Stallone is *massively* anti-gun. He has, publicly, advocated for door-to-door confiscation of all guns. Great that he's pro-Trump, but I have a hard time applying positive terms to the guy.
Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.
Anyone have a for/against(empty threat to leave the country) Trump list of celebrities?
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING. 
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
Trump is supposed to be some sort of business savvy person.  With the advantages he has had he should have done better.

It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.

Holy fucking shit I could get hundreds more people to vote for him if he did this.

Trump = Big Boss?

Also, Huey sounds eerily similar to Hillary. Just saying.
President Trump and Kojima will show konami "big league", generating the highest sales ever seen!
>"How exactly will he MAGA? He doesn't ever say how."

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
Trump: under my presidency, Ubisoft will never be able to release a bad port again, and when they downgrade the graphics, there will be consequences, BUH-LIEVE ME 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial. 
American wide summer sales. Free games when you do your taxes. Possibilities are endless. 

Trump/Gaben 2016 
Obama brought back arrested development. If Trump can HL3, I'll MAGA. 
The opposition has used fear and shaming to play against the psyche of the population. That's why you saw Trump winning almost anywhere there was a real election while the caucuses lent more towards Cruz or another candidate, being more socially accepted to voice in front of your neighbors. 
I'm going to see Rob Zombie this Sunday, and I'm going to be wearing my Trump shirt and MAGA hat.
Fuck the Berniebots that have an issue. I try to wear my Cameron Lee High Energy hat with a Trump shirt (I have every color) all weekend in public in NY. I do get sketched out about restaurants though, I fear fluid contamination.
That's a great shirt, I was looking km Trump's website and I couldn't find that particular shirt. Could you link me to where you found it??
Serious question:

I'm a patriot living abroad as a digital nomad. I want some Trump merch because it's awesome and would make some of these euro's salty as fuck, but Trump doesn't ship over seas.

What do I need to do to get some God Emperor material?
If you want the official Donald J Trump made in America shirts off his website, I'm sure one of us centipedes could receive it and send it to you. 
Aliexpress sell Trump stuff.
That Orlando and Central Florida area will be critical for Trump. It's been traditionally red with the space program and all their D.o.D. contracting. That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.
That's a good rule actually. If it wasn't there Trump could be arrested on false charges and be taken out of the running.
Rand and Bernie were the only two to fight for net neutrality from the start, Trump destroyed Paul already, but Bernie still has that on his agenda.

Now that $hillary has taken out Bernie, my votes with Trump because Hilary supported the Patriot Act in the first place.

But it must be just the free stuff amirite?
Does a single picture prove/disprove anything? Wouldn't polls/studies be more important?

Also even if the 'only racist straight sexist white hateful males are for Trump' claim wasn't true I doubt the left would drop it. Too comforting and convenient.

I've seen claims like 'minorities/women for trump have internalized self-hate'. Someone on the left might see that picture and not even recognize that these are thinking humans.
Hoping Trump will be their sugar daddy.  Especially guy in glasses.

It's like a golden Hearthstone card. Literally a Rare Trump now.
While we are taking about brainwashed...how much internet and liberal media do you listen to that say a man like Trump is a war monger? When has he said he would start wars just for money? When has the man who said he wants to protect America buy building up our military for protection say he will start wars? No instead you were brainwashed by the liberal media SJW talking points my friend. 
Trump has had a very interesting life and done so many things it's pretty amazing how clean it is.
I wouldn't act like they think this is their "end all" piece of evidence. It's been what, a few days since Bezos team was announced? Who knows what else will come out. With that being said, I can't foresee a situation where Trump did anything involving corruption and espionage on a mass scale like you know who.
I don't think that it's so much that he's "clean" I think it's more that all his dirty laundry is out in the open that it's clear no one cares. Like how lyin' Ted was under a microscope for the mistress story? It was big news because it went against his character and was a scandal. Everyone already knows Trump had affairs, so why would you dig that up and attack him with it
Hes has the best affairs. 

>"Trump cheats on super model wife with dozens of other young attractive  super models"

And we're expected to admonish him.
Cheating on your spouse is reprehensible.  It doesn't suddenly become "okay" if the affair is with someone hot.  Monogamy and families are the basic unit of Western civilization.  

The reason not to admonish Trump isn't because he cheated with hot girls, it's because it's old news.  
So this is Amazon CEO Jeff Bozo's attack.

Edit: Here's the context: https://web.archive.org/web/20160512020119/http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/ 

TL;DR New dungeon boss Amazon CEO is trying to Stump the Trump by hiring 20 man dirt army. Owns Washington Post so he also controls the media. 
Being "good" at business is not the end all of business, that sort of thinking creates globalist monopolies...such as Amazon. I wonder why Amazon doesn't want Trump...could it be because they profit massively from bad free trade agreements?
Trump said it himself :ANTITRUST 
That's just business. Trump would do the same. Power moves. 
Ok? Doesn't mean I have to support a globalist corporation who is pushing against Trump.
Trump should point this out.
In this case that person referred to Trump as a seperate person... but I like your style. 

If this is the best line of attack they can muster, Melania better get somebody to fly down to DC and start measuring drapes. 
##**BTFO**

Lol I just watched this tape. There isn't even proof that it's Trump- it doesn't even sound that much like him. Wtf were they thinking?
Its just bullshit. Liberal media will do this weekly now with any irrelevant bullshit they can find. To force him to have to answer their leading bullshit questions. And help their Marxist globalist queen Hillary. 

But it does not matter. They dont realize. Its a bad strategy. I mean, they have called him Hitler for 8 months. And he keeps moving forward! And he now is tied with her nationally, and has his own race won. While she is getting spanked by Bernie left and right and cant even secure her nomination. 

Nothing can saver her. NOt even media games. And in fact, this makes them look like bullshitters. Since everybody knows all the media is protecting her. 

Trump does not fall, much to their horror. He just keeps moving forward!

#Trump

#Rocky
Foolish Pope thinks that Smite Evil will work on Trump, but Trump's alignment is Chaotic Good. 
My feeling is that it was Trump trying to control the spin on his public persona. It's such a big "who gives a fuck?" kind of thing. He doesn't even saying anything mean about anyone. Does this compare in any way to fucking Hillary threatening Bill's rape victims, or lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation to gain money from foreign leaders? If this is the best Bezos got than Donald may as well start figuring out how he wants to decorate the Oval Office. 
Honestly. Even if this was Trump why the fuck would this be a reason I wouldn't vote for him? Everyone's done dumb shit and this is nothing compared to clintons scandals.
Trump was one of the original Jerky Boys!  We got em!
They're going to be throwing all kinds of shit at Trump's wall to see what sticks

It's just a continuation of the "Trump just disqualified himself" "The end of Trump" media memes... except they are now moving to the offense
It's a rumour that Trump used an alias and was actually his own PR person, a tactic he learned from his father. It's probably true but I don't think it's really that bad.
It just shows how fucking smart he is.

As a nobody, he also fast-talked his way into the top club in Manhattan through sheer force of will. The club president was a drunk which made it much easier, Trump said.

Trump literally bulldozed his way into the elite. They never wanted him. That's why saying he is one of them is functionally retarded.
The best part of that story is that the club owner was concerned Trump would steal all the hot wives of the other rich elite patrons.
Other celebrities use assumed names when they stay at the trump hotels to remain anonymous... Trump is so high energy he uses an assumed name so he can work a second job as his own employee. Fuck yes for America!

Good to know that "John Barron" would have answered the Benghazi phone call rather than crooked Hillary unable to rise from a white wine stupor.
Trump doesn't drink much anymore if any.  Since his brother passed away years ago.

Our Ambassadors and interests around the world can feel safe knowing that Trump will be answering the 3am phone call.  Not Hillary who will be sleeping in with a DO NOT DISTURB policy.
Can't recommend enough.  Picked up the Audio book and listen while in traffic.  Would clear up a lot of the confusion the  few #NeverTrumpers have.  The guy is an absolute madman and the first chapter narrating his phone calls with all types of people, even though he personally doesn't like but must work with to get something done.  

No sadly, Trump should remake that book with him and his kids narrating different chapters themselves.

He doesn't even say anything crazy in it. He could have said he fucked Madonna but he doesn't. It's goofy but it's such a non-issue. Trump fill figure out a way for this not to stick. 
Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump

An audio recording from 25 years ago?  Trump is calling it a scam and what else are we to believe from MSM types who have [edited surveillance tapes](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/index.html) and pushed agendas for the last decade+?
Who saves that from 25 years ago and then be able to dig it up and assume it's Trump.

For all we know that could have been made yesterday by someone in Hillary's camp.

Then you are like who owns that paper?

I thought Trump did use an alias and was actually his own PR person. His father also did the same thing from what I've read.
CNN is shilling this hard. Jake Tapper is saying that if Trump is lying about such a small matter, then he must be a huge liar about other, more important thing. 
lmao this is the best they got. An alleged 25 year old tape. Even it is The Donald, NOTHING CAN STUMP THIS MAN.

Those shillary autists are justifying her breaking federal law but this tape is the item that will end Trump.

They are so desperate. I'm glad he dealt with it and was like "Come on guys, can we please get to some more relevant shit - you can't stump the Trump." like a total alpha. Then the reporter falls in line (who is that Matt Bauer? idk I don't watch tv news anymore I just get most of my news from you amazing Pedes.) and starts talking about something more relevant and recent. Bam. I wonder if the media gets tired of being stumped all the time?
**Reporter:** "Oh hai, Mr. Trump, someone claims they went through your trash 20 years ago and they found a dirty napkin with the words 'I am a thief' written in what looks like your handwriting, can you please comment on this?"
**Trump:** "I know you're pandering to your cuck audience, but can we talk about grown up stuff?"

SAVAGE!
LOL. The traitors are getting so desperate. Poor Jeff Bozo of Amazon hates Trump. 

Has like **20** of his "journalist" whose only job now is to bullshit about Trump as much as they can. Since that paper also loves Obama, and Hillary. At least 20 is what was reported. They probably got more, all working in some dungeon 24/7, and muttering "we must get Trump, we must get Trump". "we are with her, we are with her, Hillary"

To force him to have to answer bullshit like this when he goes on these liberal shows with these "journalist". 

It will not stop him. When will you learn media. NOBODY likes you that much anymore. Both sides think you are garbage now. NObody really trust you that much. Most just see you as a Soap Opera of bullshit. 

#WashingtonPost

LMAO. I laugh at thee. 

Even toilet paper is more relevant, and useful than much of our media and what is considered "journalism" now. 

The more you attack him, the more people get fed up with so much of your bullshit.  

Of course, **#CrookedHillary** is just facing a casual "security inquiry" liberal media. Just like getting an anti virus check. Thats what the FBI is doing. Protect her all you can Media. People still hate her. And Trump will easily Schlong her.  
it's the same as the Bill DiBlasio ad that I've heard on radio in recent months that apparently tries to criticize Trump using an "audio recording of his own voice" but when you listen it sounds like someone already doing a bad voice impersonation and the pitch is too high. Liberals have no shame, and they will pull any trick to make you believe the other side is bad.
[Here's the full story with the full 15 minute video.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)

Frankly if this the best attack they have, they're going to lose. Trump making sure he gets the correct spin on his public persona doesn't really compare to Hillary lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation as a way to launder money, or threatening Bill's rape victims.
WTF man. Between this and that other interviewer who wouldn't drop the tax return bull shit. 

I can't wait until Trump is the next President and make them all look like complete idiots. 
Listened to the tape. Didn't hear anything particularly damning, but it does sound like Trump. Not so much in tone but how he speaks.
Honestly, this is almost definitely Trump. The accent is good, but it's unmistakably Trump's cadence, and Trumps NYC accent creeps in from time to time. I don't know why Trump's denying it - it's actually kind of funny.

The good news, though, is that this is apparently the worst dirt the media has been able to dig up on Trump. Sad!
He probably was mean to someone in one of these calls and figures it's best to deny the whole thing.

Let's compare: Trump probably lying about posing as his own publicist 25 years ago vs. Hillary trying to throw a filmmaker under the bus and blame him for violence/killings while lying to Benghazi victims' families.
LOL!

So this 25 year old prank call recording is the best they have to trash Trump with? Give me a break.
It's a totally hilarious radio interview of Trump pretending to be Trump's spokesman, explaining his then-current situation with women, real estate and maybe more I didn't hear.

This is definitely a guy that would be fun to have a beer with.

If the press can't get a legit smile out of it, they have no sense of humor.
WaPo Bezos vanity project, nobody can read it without retching. Story about phony call means nothing but intent is to trash Trump that he called under presumed name, no evidence. Worse than Tabloid which has true stories about Ted. Idiotic, phony hoax. Happens all the time to stupid news people. They just want to smear Trump with their boy reporter suspicions which are meaningless. He was a private person. What about the 20 years Obama spent with Rev Right and G-d America? Investigating Obama should be interesting such as his birth certificate. Where were they during Bengazi, those two incompetents, Hillary and Obama? Investigating Hillary should yield gold for the WaPo. Investigating Bill-ary and how she Enables the Energizer Bunny for Bill, who gives this rich divorcee bombshell Foundation money, that's juicy and it is relevant. Because like all the things Hillary does, it is ILLEGAL and provable.
As a New Yorker, the voices are clearly different.

If you can't tell, this is what Trump sounded like in 1991: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw

I'll concede the phrasing sounds like Trump, but it's either not him or he heavily toned down his intonation and speaking mannerisms. I've also heard Trump talk with a lower key on CNN over the phone and it still doesn't sound like the guy in the video.

Here's a more recent phone interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMwzElHMcHU

Of course, I could be wrong, because some excepts sound more like him than others, but if it was him, he was definitely masking it.
Trumps voice from 25 years ago was much higher pitched than it is now. I listened but I just don't think it was him. They probably heard that he did that and decided to try one out with an impersonator to see if they could pull it off. Anyway, it is so petty compared to all the email and other scandals.

I know your feel bro. I am spaniard and I has already redpilled my family about Trump. I showed them Stefan Molyneux' data and videos about Medial lies on Trump. [Pic related](http://imgur.com/8vl4HzN.jpg)

MEGA = MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN
I convinced my father, swayed my mom a little. Sister is a Berniebot and an SJW sadly.

She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans", and that "He ran a campaign based on serving the rich" and threw a tantrum and the room. Also said something about how voting republican is like the worst thing ever no matter what.

SJWism to a tee. Sadly for her it just convinced my father and mother that I was right.
> She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans"

He does, and he should.  He DOESN'T want to deport Americans.  And if you're an American, a citizen of the united states, you're not going anywhere.  If you're a Mexican, a citizen of MEXICO, and you didn't get permission to be here then you should absolutely get thrown the fuck out.
>She insisted that "He [Trump] ran a campaign based on serving the rich"

HAHAHAHA what? Trump has literally promised the exact opposite of that! It's half the reason he's so appealing to regular American!
Just remember that a lot of us liberals will be voting for Trump if Sanders doesn't get the nomination. We're not all bad!
>  Sister is a Berniebot and an SJW sadly.

I've had a nice debate with my dorm neighbour last weekend

He seen me watching Trump on YT, and we talked for quite a bit (he was pro-hillary, but he told me he had no interest in elections - almost).

Now the good bit? He's pro-trump now, and we both agreed that this election is very thrilling to watch.

The bad one? I'm a Russian who lives in Czech Republic, he's CZ guy, so no votes from us. :(
I currently live in Germany with the family and the amount of Trump supporters here is just massively growing.

I think Hillary reminds them of Merkel. 
I went to dinner with my (legal) immigrant grandparents and father and they started talking about how much they love Trump. Good stuff.
As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

Proof: the 2008 recession which most european countries are still feeling the effects of.

It's hard to admit, but the world depends on the us as much as the us depends on the rest of the world.
> As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

I wish the rest of the world recognized this truth!
Yeah I keep trying to convince my parents that Trump is a God Emperor, but in the end it doesn't really matter. 
hahahahaha. I'm trying SO hard to convert my sister, since she's one of those 'Trump is racist' robots. Not really working :/ but still lots of fun to fight with these types of people in person. 

She wants Canada to accept more refugees. She doesn't really work and her husband supports her.... I asked her why don't they sponsor a refugee family if they want to help them so much. And she was like 'no that's not my job, it's the government's". LOGIC 

Sadly, she's ready to support her American friends in whatever way she can if they decide to move to Canada after Trump wins. >_____>
It's sad. Really sad, to see my gender act this way.

A few years ago I would have been triggered by your typical woman comment. But after the refugee crisis and Trump, my eyes are open to how irrational and ignorant a lot of women are.  All the women in my life lack reason. My sister calls herself a feminist and openly hates on men, who have supported her and given her a life of comfort. She does not recognize their struggles or suffering at all, I have tried to reason with her. But all our arguments end up with her running away, or crying or her saying "I'M RIGHT. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE OLDER"

Well, I'm nearing 30 and I still don't understand their logic.   
thanks! ^_^ haha. yeah I know all women are not like that. I'll meet some good ones someday. My sister does have a friend who is a Trump supporter. My sister regularly threatens to unfriend her and I kindly remind her it's ridiculous to unfriend someone because of a difference of opinion.  

my bf is a reasonable man. he constantly challenges my ideas (in other words MISOGYNY), and I'm better because of that constant exchange. I am so grateful I didn't end up with some cuck
Oooo attempts at diverting.

Impossible that a Trump sub, of all the reddit possibilities is the only one you like.

It's just, if you're actually American and lying, you're doing more harm than good. If you're European with some odd obsession, than do more to prove it, please.

I think it also has something to do with Robin Williams holding a special place in my heart and that song being one of my favorite Disney songs if not my absolute favorite. I like to think if he was still around he would do great imitations of Trump and $hillary.

Besides all that, the song is a great choice for this parody since in the original lyrics there's literally a line that says, "Brush up your Sunday salaam."
Yeah, I called this MONTHS ago. Trump had this figured out every step of the way. 
Nobody knew who Kelly was before Trump. Trump was Kelly's greatest career booster of all time and she knows it and shes milking it out as much as she can, and if she has to make Trump look good while doing it then she will. That is all there is to it. 
This. So much of what we might call the media conspiracy is just whatever sells sells. Fox producers aren't dumb, but they can only control so much. In this case it's most probably an obvious win win scenario for Megyn Kelly. She either comes out as the woman who ousted a sexist candidate, or she becomes the woman who vetted the next president. They both need each other either way. 

This is gonna be so good for Trump I think. He just keeps looking death in the face and not blinking. He is the absolute madman. 
It's gonna be great though. All of the people that took Megyn Kelly's side in the feud will become Trump supporters if they aren't already.
I am excited. And I had know clue it was going to be on Fox Broadcasting. Ratings will be huge. I truly wonder how many uninformed Bearny supports will be watching and would be amazed that Daddy Trump is not the man /r/politics makes him out to be. Liberals better bring a pen and a notebook with them when they watch this interview cause they will be schooled.
No one cheers when Trump's name is mentioned, someone boos.  Of course. 
PREDICTION: They'll manipulate the color space in their final broadcasted product. I mean they already did that even in that short clip: just look at the very different skin tones of Kelly and Trump who looks unnaturally red in their images. What they've done with the skin tones is on purpose, because it's not like Trump had an acute case of being sunstruck on that day.
how can you guys be supporting her, she is going everywhere talking so negative about Trump.

She says she doesn't understand where Trump was coming from, she was doing hit pieces every night on her primetime show especially right before primaries.  She has the record for the most airtime given to Michelle Fields and company and just last night she had on Ben Shapiro laughing this whole race up.
I can't believe some of these comments. This bitch is toxic as hell, and clearly still talks badly about Trump
#**[Daily reminder that Donald made her cut her hair.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3552478/It-s-empowering-Fox-s-Megyn-Kelly-reveals-chopped-long-blonde-hair-height-feud-Donald-Trump-stronger-mood.html)**
I think she's genuine, I just think she just genuinely thinks that she didn't do anything to deserve the tweets Trump was sending out.

Maybe we'll learn more about it during the interview.
She seems a little nervous and genuine talking about it. Fallon completely misread the situation, and the jokes doesn't really fit conversation. Her interview with Trump should be interesting, and I believe both of them respect each other despite what happened. 
The interview will reveal she will be Trump's running mate.

MAGA - Trump 2016


He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4j5xrh/donald_trump_denies_washington_post_audio_full/
They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

Or show you this:

**Our media are our enemy now. Most of it is garbage. And most of them are liberal marxist globalist snake pieces of shit. Not journalist anymore. But professional race baiters, bullshitters, and manipulators.** 
Before the end of my life I must make a pilgrimage to Trump Tower and partake in the World's Greatest Taco Bowls.

#TRUMP TACO BOWL > JEB! GUAC BOWLE
Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.  

**Trump steel won't bend or break.**
#MAGA
Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.
Pretty sure this is gonna end up on a Can't Stump The Trump video
Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
How embarrassing. You can hear the desperation in his voice trying to nail Trump on his tax returns and then actually trying to defend Hillary for her missing emails.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Trump is fearless.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thank you. You'd be doing us and yourself a favor by sharing my story with your friends who may be against the idea of Trump. This sentence sums it up: Either you're for Trump, or you hate America.
We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
Thank you so much, I (we) really appreciate that. I hope you share my story with your friends, especially if they're against Trump. That man is a blessing from the heavens. Without him we'd be stuck with establishment assholes who only want to Globalize the world into misery. 
Asylum because religious persecution by muslims in Bosnia. We're catholic. As soon as these snakes have the majority, it's game over.

Three big reasons why I'm voting for Trump:

* Illegal immigration needs to stop

* Muslims should not be taken in by the thousands (they're not our friends, believe me)

* Gun rights
I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
Personally I think Trump could get as much as 60% of the black vote.

This would be absolutely devastating to Hillary for every black person were vote for Trump
No, even in this poll [Clinton is up by 2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/Gravis_National_Trump_Clinton_May_2016.pdf) I don't know where they got this split from, but I can't imagine it's right. In what universe does the Democratic candidate lose the hispanic vote and still win overall?
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs. 
Mccain got 3, Romney gets 7, Trump gets 13. 
That will help Trump's push into the rust belt and northeast. Romney list every damn state North and East of Kentucky
#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.

I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Doesn't need to say anything, the hard core believers take anything said about trump negatively.

Trump pets a puppy

Oh no trump hates kittens
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
Trump should retweet it.
Well, the implication of what Trump said is that women in general *aren't* doing as good a job as men (as evidenced by the fact they are paid less). And that's kind of an offensive thing to say.
Hills on the Trump Train now!
But...seriously.  Trump basically said 'Equal Pay for Equal Work' and they try to say 'look, look!  What a bad guy!'
The debate writes itself!

Hillary: And Donald Trump's sexist remarks cannot stand! He says women will make the same pay if they do the same job!

Everybody: ....and?

And jesus, that tweet:
-Trump says women will get equal pay for equal work

-Trump cherishes women

-Time to believe what Trump says

Savage?
"Worst mistake"? Nobody on Hillary's twitter is going to read this positively.

In it's excitement, this sub has lost it's mind a bit. Just another flavor of sanders for president now.

Good luck to Trump, really hope he wins, I'm done with reddit for a long time.
Well the guy on the right is wearing a Trump shirt... #trigger

Does the middle guy's shirt say Zodiac?? Can't read it.
Cucks were trembling in anger, but our Trump team covered the entire school in posters and Trump chalk.

Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character. One of them takes a nuanced approach and pokes fun at himself during it, while the other gets on a soapbox about refugees. I guarantee none of those refugees will be anywhere near his mountainside mansion in Italy.  
> Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character.

For having made a career glorifying gun violence, Stallone is *massively* anti-gun. He has, publicly, advocated for door-to-door confiscation of all guns. Great that he's pro-Trump, but I have a hard time applying positive terms to the guy.
Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.
Anyone have a for/against(empty threat to leave the country) Trump list of celebrities?
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING. 
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
Trump is supposed to be some sort of business savvy person.  With the advantages he has had he should have done better. 
According to who? or what criteria? 

Trump's doing pretty well, wouldn't you say? Would you agree he's at least doing *okay* as far as his financial situation goes?

It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial.

That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.
That's a good rule actually. If it wasn't there Trump could be arrested on false charges and be taken out of the running.
Rand and Bernie were the only two to fight for net neutrality from the start, Trump destroyed Paul already, but Bernie still has that on his agenda.

Now that $hillary has taken out Bernie, my votes with Trump because Hilary supported the Patriot Act in the first place.

But it must be just the free stuff amirite?
Does a single picture prove/disprove anything? Wouldn't polls/studies be more important?

Also even if the 'only racist straight sexist white hateful males are for Trump' claim wasn't true I doubt the left would drop it. Too comforting and convenient.

I've seen claims like 'minorities/women for trump have internalized self-hate'. Someone on the left might see that picture and not even recognize that these are thinking humans.
Hoping Trump will be their sugar daddy.  Especially guy in glasses.
Trump has had a very interesting life and done so many things it's pretty amazing how clean it is.
I wouldn't act like they think this is their "end all" piece of evidence. It's been what, a few days since Bezos team was announced? Who knows what else will come out. With that being said, I can't foresee a situation where Trump did anything involving corruption and espionage on a mass scale like you know who.
I don't think that it's so much that he's "clean" I think it's more that all his dirty laundry is out in the open that it's clear no one cares. Like how lyin' Ted was under a microscope for the mistress story? It was big news because it went against his character and was a scandal. Everyone already knows Trump had affairs, so why would you dig that up and attack him with it
Hes has the best affairs. 

>"Trump cheats on super model wife with dozens of other young attractive  super models"

And we're expected to admonish him.
Cheating on your spouse is reprehensible.  It doesn't suddenly become "okay" if the affair is with someone hot.  Monogamy and families are the basic unit of Western civilization.  

The reason not to admonish Trump isn't because he cheated with hot girls, it's because it's old news.  
So this is Amazon CEO Jeff Bozo's attack.

Edit: Here's the context: https://web.archive.org/web/20160512020119/http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/ 

TL;DR New dungeon boss Amazon CEO is trying to Stump the Trump by hiring 20 man dirt army. Owns Washington Post so he also controls the media. 
Being "good" at business is not the end all of business, that sort of thinking creates globalist monopolies...such as Amazon. I wonder why Amazon doesn't want Trump...could it be because they profit massively from bad free trade agreements?
Trump said it himself :ANTITRUST 
That's just business. Trump would do the same. Power moves. 
Ok? Doesn't mean I have to support a globalist corporation who is pushing against Trump.
Trump should point this out.
In this case that person referred to Trump as a seperate person... but I like your style. 

If this is the best line of attack they can muster, Melania better get somebody to fly down to DC and start measuring drapes. 
##**BTFO**

Lol I just watched this tape. There isn't even proof that it's Trump- it doesn't even sound that much like him. Wtf were they thinking?
Its just bullshit. Liberal media will do this weekly now with any irrelevant bullshit they can find. To force him to have to answer their leading bullshit questions. And help their Marxist globalist queen Hillary. 

But it does not matter. They dont realize. Its a bad strategy. I mean, they have called him Hitler for 8 months. And he keeps moving forward! And he now is tied with her nationally, and has his own race won. While she is getting spanked by Bernie left and right and cant even secure her nomination. 

Nothing can saver her. NOt even media games. And in fact, this makes them look like bullshitters. Since everybody knows all the media is protecting her. 

Trump does not fall, much to their horror. He just keeps moving forward!

Foolish Pope thinks that Smite Evil will work on Trump, but Trump's alignment is Chaotic Good. 
My feeling is that it was Trump trying to control the spin on his public persona. It's such a big "who gives a fuck?" kind of thing. He doesn't even saying anything mean about anyone. Does this compare in any way to fucking Hillary threatening Bill's rape victims, or lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation to gain money from foreign leaders? If this is the best Bezos got than Donald may as well start figuring out how he wants to decorate the Oval Office. 
Honestly. Even if this was Trump why the fuck would this be a reason I wouldn't vote for him? Everyone's done dumb shit and this is nothing compared to clintons scandals.
Trump was one of the original Jerky Boys!  We got em!
They're going to be throwing all kinds of shit at Trump's wall to see what sticks

It's just a continuation of the "Trump just disqualified himself" "The end of Trump" media memes... except they are now moving to the offense
It's a rumour that Trump used an alias and was actually his own PR person, a tactic he learned from his father. It's probably true but I don't think it's really that bad.
It just shows how fucking smart he is.

As a nobody, he also fast-talked his way into the top club in Manhattan through sheer force of will. The club president was a drunk which made it much easier, Trump said.

Trump literally bulldozed his way into the elite. They never wanted him. That's why saying he is one of them is functionally retarded.
The best part of that story is that the club owner was concerned Trump would steal all the hot wives of the other rich elite patrons.
Other celebrities use assumed names when they stay at the trump hotels to remain anonymous... Trump is so high energy he uses an assumed name so he can work a second job as his own employee. Fuck yes for America!

Good to know that "John Barron" would have answered the Benghazi phone call rather than crooked Hillary unable to rise from a white wine stupor.
Trump doesn't drink much anymore if any.  Since his brother passed away years ago.

Our Ambassadors and interests around the world can feel safe knowing that Trump will be answering the 3am phone call.  Not Hillary who will be sleeping in with a DO NOT DISTURB policy.
Can't recommend enough.  Picked up the Audio book and listen while in traffic.  Would clear up a lot of the confusion the  few #NeverTrumpers have.  The guy is an absolute madman and the first chapter narrating his phone calls with all types of people, even though he personally doesn't like but must work with to get something done.  

No sadly, Trump should remake that book with him and his kids narrating different chapters themselves.  

*Plane trip + audacity have it done in no time*

He doesn't even say anything crazy in it. He could have said he fucked Madonna but he doesn't. It's goofy but it's such a non-issue. Trump fill figure out a way for this not to stick. 
Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump

> http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/#9a6l7wRUBBbSMlEP.99

An audio recording from 25 years ago?  Trump is calling it a scam and what else are we to believe from MSM types who have [edited surveillance tapes](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/index.html) and pushed agendas for the last decade+?
Who saves that from 25 years ago and then be able to dig it up and assume it's Trump.

For all we know that could have been made yesterday by someone in Hillary's camp.
> the washington post

Then you are like who owns that paper?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos

CEO of Amazon. 

[Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump](http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/)
I thought Trump did use an alias and was actually his own PR person. His father also did the same thing from what I've read.
CNN is shilling this hard. Jake Tapper is saying that if Trump is lying about such a small matter, then he must be a huge liar about other, more important thing. 
lmao this is the best they got. An alleged 25 year old tape. Even it is The Donald, NOTHING CAN STUMP THIS MAN.

Those shillary autists are justifying her breaking federal law but this tape is the item that will end Trump.

They are so desperate. I'm glad he dealt with it and was like "Come on guys, can we please get to some more relevant shit - you can't stump the Trump." like a total alpha. Then the reporter falls in line (who is that Matt Bauer? idk I don't watch tv news anymore I just get most of my news from you amazing Pedes.) and starts talking about something more relevant and recent. Bam. I wonder if the media gets tired of being stumped all the time?
**Reporter:** "Oh hai, Mr. Trump, someone claims they went through your trash 20 years ago and they found a dirty napkin with the words 'I am a thief' written in what looks like your handwriting, can you please comment on this?"
**Trump:** "I know you're pandering to your cuck audience, but can we talk about grown up stuff?"

SAVAGE!
LOL. The traitors are getting so desperate. Poor Jeff Bozo of Amazon hates Trump. 

Has like **20** of his "journalist" whose only job now is to bullshit about Trump as much as they can. Since that paper also loves Obama, and Hillary. At least 20 is what was reported. They probably got more, all working in some dungeon 24/7, and muttering "we must get Trump, we must get Trump". "we are with her, we are with her, Hillary"

To force him to have to answer bullshit like this when he goes on these liberal shows with these "journalist". 

It will not stop him. When will you learn media. NOBODY likes you that much anymore. Both sides think you are garbage now. NObody really trust you that much. Most just see you as a Soap Opera of bullshit. 

#WashingtonPost

LMAO. I laugh at thee. 

Even toilet paper is more relevant, and useful than much of our media and what is considered "journalism" now. 

The more you attack him, the more people get fed up with so much of your bullshit.  

Of course, **#CrookedHillary** is just facing a casual "security inquiry" liberal media. Just like getting an anti virus check. Thats what the FBI is doing. Protect her all you can Media. People still hate her. And Trump will easily Schlong her.  
it's the same as the Bill DiBlasio ad that I've heard on radio in recent months that apparently tries to criticize Trump using an "audio recording of his own voice" but when you listen it sounds like someone already doing a bad voice impersonation and the pitch is too high. Liberals have no shame, and they will pull any trick to make you believe the other side is bad.
[Here's the full story with the full 15 minute video.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)

Frankly if this the best attack they have, they're going to lose. Trump making sure he gets the correct spin on his public persona doesn't really compare to Hillary lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation as a way to launder money, or threatening Bill's rape victims.
WTF man. Between this and that other interviewer who wouldn't drop the tax return bull shit. 

I can't wait until Trump is the next President and make them all look like complete idiots. 
Listened to the tape. Didn't hear anything particularly damning, but it does sound like Trump. Not so much in tone but how he speaks.
Honestly, this is almost definitely Trump. The accent is good, but it's unmistakably Trump's cadence, and Trumps NYC accent creeps in from time to time. I don't know why Trump's denying it - it's actually kind of funny.

The good news, though, is that this is apparently the worst dirt the media has been able to dig up on Trump. Sad!
He probably was mean to someone in one of these calls and figures it's best to deny the whole thing.

Let's compare: Trump probably lying about posing as his own publicist 25 years ago vs. Hillary trying to throw a filmmaker under the bus and blame him for violence/killings while lying to Benghazi victims' families.
LOL!

So this 25 year old prank call recording is the best they have to trash Trump with? Give me a break.
It's a totally hilarious radio interview of Trump pretending to be Trump's spokesman, explaining his then-current situation with women, real estate and maybe more I didn't hear.

This is definitely a guy that would be fun to have a beer with.

If the press can't get a legit smile out of it, they have no sense of humor.
WaPo Bezos vanity project, nobody can read it without retching. Story about phony call means nothing but intent is to trash Trump that he called under presumed name, no evidence. Worse than Tabloid which has true stories about Ted. Idiotic, phony hoax. Happens all the time to stupid news people. They just want to smear Trump with their boy reporter suspicions which are meaningless. He was a private person. What about the 20 years Obama spent with Rev Right and G-d America? Investigating Obama should be interesting such as his birth certificate. Where were they during Bengazi, those two incompetents, Hillary and Obama? Investigating Hillary should yield gold for the WaPo. Investigating Bill-ary and how she Enables the Energizer Bunny for Bill, who gives this rich divorcee bombshell Foundation money, that's juicy and it is relevant. Because like all the things Hillary does, it is ILLEGAL and provable.
As a New Yorker, the voices are clearly different.

If you can't tell, this is what Trump sounded like in 1991: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw

I'll concede the phrasing sounds like Trump, but it's either not him or he heavily toned down his intonation and speaking mannerisms. I've also heard Trump talk with a lower key on CNN over the phone and it still doesn't sound like the guy in the video.

Here's a more recent phone interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMwzElHMcHU

Of course, I could be wrong, because some excepts sound more like him than others, but if it was him, he was definitely masking it.
Trumps voice from 25 years ago was much higher pitched than it is now. I listened but I just don't think it was him. They probably heard that he did that and decided to try one out with an impersonator to see if they could pull it off. Anyway, it is so petty compared to all the email and other scandals.  
#**Lmao i dont doubt for a second it wasn't Donald Trump but this just makes me love him even more MAGA**

While we are taking about brainwashed...how much internet and liberal media do you listen to that say a man like Trump is a war monger? When has he said he would start wars just for money? When has the man who said he wants to protect America buy building up our military for protection say he will start wars? No instead you were brainwashed by the liberal media SJW talking points my friend.

I convinced my father, swayed my mom a little. Sister is a Berniebot and an SJW sadly.

She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans", and that "He ran a campaign based on serving the rich" and threw a tantrum and the room. Also said something about how voting republican is like the worst thing ever no matter what.

SJWism to a tee. Sadly for her it just convinced my father and mother that I was right.
> She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans"

He does, and he should.  He DOESN'T want to deport Americans.  And if you're an American, a citizen of the united states, you're not going anywhere.  If you're a Mexican, a citizen of MEXICO, and you didn't get permission to be here then you should absolutely get thrown the fuck out.
>She insisted that "He [Trump] ran a campaign based on serving the rich"

HAHAHAHA what? Trump has literally promised the exact opposite of that! It's half the reason he's so appealing to regular American!
Just remember that a lot of us liberals will be voting for Trump if Sanders doesn't get the nomination. We're not all bad!

I've had a nice debate with my dorm neighbour last weekend

He seen me watching Trump on YT, and we talked for quite a bit (he was pro-hillary, but he told me he had no interest in elections - almost).

Now the good bit? He's pro-trump now, and we both agreed that this election is very thrilling to watch.

The bad one? I'm a Russian who lives in Czech Republic, he's CZ guy, so no votes from us. :(
I currently live in Germany with the family and the amount of Trump supporters here is just massively growing.

I think Hillary reminds them of Merkel. 
I went to dinner with my (legal) immigrant grandparents and father and they started talking about how much they love Trump. Good stuff.
As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

Proof: the 2008 recession which most european countries are still feeling the effects of.

It's hard to admit, but the world depends on the us as much as the us depends on the rest of the world.
> As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

I wish the rest of the world recognized this truth!
Yeah I keep trying to convince my parents that Trump is a God Emperor, but in the end it doesn't really matter. 
hahahahaha. I'm trying SO hard to convert my sister, since she's one of those 'Trump is racist' robots. Not really working :/ but still lots of fun to fight with these types of people in person. 

She wants Canada to accept more refugees. She doesn't really work and her husband supports her.... I asked her why don't they sponsor a refugee family if they want to help them so much. And she was like 'no that's not my job, it's the government's". LOGIC 

Sadly, she's ready to support her American friends in whatever way she can if they decide to move to Canada after Trump wins. >_____>
It's sad. Really sad, to see my gender act this way.

A few years ago I would have been triggered by your typical woman comment. But after the refugee crisis and Trump, my eyes are open to how irrational and ignorant a lot of women are.  All the women in my life lack reason. My sister calls herself a feminist and openly hates on men, who have supported her and given her a life of comfort. She does not recognize their struggles or suffering at all, I have tried to reason with her. But all our arguments end up with her running away, or crying or her saying "I'M RIGHT. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE OLDER"

Well, I'm nearing 30 and I still don't understand their logic.   
thanks! ^_^ haha. yeah I know all women are not like that. I'll meet some good ones someday. My sister does have a friend who is a Trump supporter. My sister regularly threatens to unfriend her and I kindly remind her it's ridiculous to unfriend someone because of a difference of opinion.  

my bf is a reasonable man. he constantly challenges my ideas (in other words MISOGYNY), and I'm better because of that constant exchange. I am so grateful I didn't end up with some cuck
Oooo attempts at diverting.

Impossible that a Trump sub, of all the reddit possibilities is the only one you like.

It's just, if you're actually American and lying, you're doing more harm than good. If you're European with some odd obsession, than do more to prove it, please.

This is the same publication that put articles about Trump under "entertainment" when he first ran for President. Nothing at this point surprises when it comes to the Cuckington Post. 
I think it also has something to do with Robin Williams holding a special place in my heart and that song being one of my favorite Disney songs if not my absolute favorite. I like to think if he was still around he would do great imitations of Trump and $hillary.

Besides all that, the song is a great choice for this parody since in the original lyrics there's literally a line that says, "Brush up your Sunday salaam."

Thx Mr. Trump
Many moons ago, my ancestors roamed this land, eat many buffalo and life was good. But at the same time my other ancestors were in europe and came here and now I'm 1/16th blackfoot with blonde hair and blue eyes. So am I an aryan nazi Trump supporter, or am I an indigenous native? You tell me Faker-gawea.

MAGA - Trump 2016


He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
#THIS IS WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT TRUMP.#

I've been saying this for months now to friends and family that what I love most about Trump is he is UNAPOLOGETICLY himself. He doesn't apologize for trying to pay as little as he can. It's such a breath of fresh fucking air.  
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4j5xrh/donald_trump_denies_washington_post_audio_full/
They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxaKUo5naoY

Or show you this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCHZbB-M9oE

**Our media are our enemy now. Most of it is garbage. And most of them are liberal marxist globalist snake pieces of shit. Not journalist anymore. But professional race baiters, bullshitters, and manipulators.** 
Before the end of my life I must make a pilgrimage to Trump Tower and partake in the World's Greatest Taco Bowls.

#TRUMP TACO BOWL > JEB! GUAC BOWLE
Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.  

**Trump steel won't bend or break.**
#MAGA
Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.
Pretty sure this is gonna end up on a Can't Stump The Trump video
Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
How embarrassing. You can hear the desperation in his voice trying to nail Trump on his tax returns and then actually trying to defend Hillary for her missing emails.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
I was a trump supporter (small t) prior to this morning, but what the hell just happened on GMA this morning made me a Mega TRUMP supporter.  Finally a man that has something hanging between his legs and can tell it how it is, not that he has not been doing this all along, but hey, way to shut up snuffaluffagas.  You have my vote Mr Trump.
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
I can't believe Stepnfetchitopolous tried to Stump The Trump. 
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Trump is fearless.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
Even if Trump is in the clear with the tax issues, and he is actually waiting for the audit to end, this makes him look bad. It is one of the few things that Hillary has got against him, even though it is nothing serious. The fact that they keep saying he hasn't released them is not a good viewpoint for Trump. Never will the media call Hillary out for her crimes, her crimes in Benghazi, her threats and maybe even murders of past people in the "clinton circle", or the threats to bill's former women, but they will never speak a word. But for Trump, they will make him seem like a criminal for not releasing his tax info yet. 
It was probably done by their professional chef to make sure it looks perfect. Under Trump we should train all cooks to be chefs. 

**Make Our Food Great Again**
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thank you. You'd be doing us and yourself a favor by sharing my story with your friends who may be against the idea of Trump. This sentence sums it up: Either you're for Trump, or you hate America.
We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
Thank you so much, I (we) really appreciate that. I hope you share my story with your friends, especially if they're against Trump. That man is a blessing from the heavens. Without him we'd be stuck with establishment assholes who only want to Globalize the world into misery. 
Asylum because religious persecution by muslims in Bosnia. We're catholic. As soon as these snakes have the majority, it's game over.

Three big reasons why I'm voting for Trump:

* Illegal immigration needs to stop

* Muslims should not be taken in by the thousands (they're not our friends, believe me)

* Gun rights
This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
Personally I think Trump could get as much as 60% of the black vote.

This would be absolutely devastating to Hillary for every black person were vote for Trump
No, even in this poll [Clinton is up by 2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2016/Gravis_National_Trump_Clinton_May_2016.pdf) I don't know where they got this split from, but I can't imagine it's right. In what universe does the Democratic candidate lose the hispanic vote and still win overall?
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs. 
Mccain got 3, Romney gets 7, Trump gets 13. 
That will help Trump's push into the rust belt and northeast. Romney list every damn state North and East of Kentucky
#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.
Status:

Libtards: Stumped

Bernie Bots: Cucked

Trump: Ascended God
I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
The problem is the media, activists and the politicians have fooled themselves into believing Hispanics are one homogeneous group or race of people that can be controlled politically.That ignorance will cost the Dems votes and Trump will do better than everyone is expecting with Hispanic voters.
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Doesn't need to say anything, the hard core believers take anything said about trump negatively.

Trump pets a puppy

Oh no trump hates kittens
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
Her daughter said that she is a fake, a slob, neglectful parent. And also that she abandoned her and did not help her during a drug  problem. But Rosie thought Trump was evil for giving Miss America another chance with her drug problem.

And Rosie calls Trump the evil one almost weekly. Of course, it is Trump that has 5 loving, loyal, humble, kind, not druggies,  well adjusted, and the older ones completely successful children. 

I have not heard about the alocoholism. But if i remember her daughter did say  Rosie drinks a lot of beer daily. 
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Shit's like dissing Dre. You try to stump Trump you just stump yo'self.
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
Trump should retweet it.
Well, the implication of what Trump said is that women in general *aren't* doing as good a job as men (as evidenced by the fact they are paid less). And that's kind of an offensive thing to say.
Hills on the Trump Train now!
But...seriously.  Trump basically said 'Equal Pay for Equal Work' and they try to say 'look, look!  What a bad guy!'
The debate writes itself!

Hillary: And Donald Trump's sexist remarks cannot stand! He says women will make the same pay if they do the same job!

Everybody: ....and?

And jesus, that tweet:

-Trump says women will get equal pay for equal work

-Trump cherishes women

-Time to believe what Trump says

Savage?

Crime is the disease. Trump is the cure.
Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character. One of them takes a nuanced approach and pokes fun at himself during it, while the other gets on a soapbox about refugees. I guarantee none of those refugees will be anywhere near his mountainside mansion in Italy.  
> Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character.

As they do nothing but try to make people fearful of a Trump presidency.  They are everything that they rail against.  
For having made a career glorifying gun violence, Stallone is *massively* anti-gun. He has, publicly, advocated for door-to-door confiscation of all guns. Great that he's pro-Trump, but I have a hard time applying positive terms to the guy.
Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.
Anyone have a for/against(empty threat to leave the country) Trump list of celebrities?
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING. 
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
According to who? or what criteria? 

Trump's doing pretty well, wouldn't you say? Would you agree he's at least doing *okay* as far as his financial situation goes?

It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.

tired of this cuck trying to bandwagon off of the glorious leader Trump
ah yeah,,,that exactly the point to reach a bigger audience and start uncucking people and simply not engagins is starting to not work just like demonizing people isnt, perfect example 

#Lord God Emperor Trump 
Holy fucking shit I could get hundreds more people to vote for him if he did this.

Trump = Big Boss?

Also, Huey sounds eerily similar to Hillary. Just saying.
President Trump and Kojima will show konami "big league", generating the highest sales ever seen!
>"How exactly will he MAGA? He doesn't ever say how."

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial. 
Trump: under my presidency, Ubisoft will never be able to release a bad port again, and when they downgrade the graphics, there will be consequences, BUH-LIEVE ME 
American wide summer sales. Free games when you do your taxes. Possibilities are endless. 

Trump/Gaben 2016 
Obama brought back arrested development. If Trump can HL3, I'll MAGA. 
He shouldnt have to say how. He's Donald Trump. Making things great is literaly what he does all day. He cant help but makes things great.
For a blue state, I've gotten a lot of supportive comments when I wear my Trump hoodie around in NY. Always in the doctor's office though I get a bunch of thumbs up and things, loooot of doctors seem to love him.
The opposition has used fear and shaming to play against the psyche of the population. That's why you saw Trump winning almost anywhere there was a real election while the caucuses lent more towards Cruz or another candidate, being more socially accepted to voice in front of your neighbors. 
I'm going to see Rob Zombie this Sunday, and I'm going to be wearing my Trump shirt and MAGA hat.
Fuck the Berniebots that have an issue. I try to wear my Cameron Lee High Energy hat with a Trump shirt (I have every color) all weekend in public in NY. I do get sketched out about restaurants though, I fear fluid contamination.
That's a great shirt, I was looking km Trump's website and I couldn't find that particular shirt. Could you link me to where you found it??
That Orlando and Central Florida area will be critical for Trump. It's been traditionally red with the space program and all their D.o.D. contracting. That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
Serious question:

I'm a patriot living abroad as a digital nomad. I want some Trump merch because it's awesome and would make some of these euro's salty as fuck, but Trump doesn't ship over seas.

What do I need to do to get some God Emperor material?
If you want the official Donald J Trump made in America shirts off his website, I'm sure one of us centipedes could receive it and send it to you. 
Aliexpress sell Trump stuff.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
Assuming it's Disneyland, then you're actually really brave. Hell as someone who lives in OC I'd never get a Trump bumper sticker on my car because the odds of me going to cities like Santa Ana and having it unscathed or even me not getting harassed are low.
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.
That's a good rule actually. If it wasn't there Trump could be arrested on false charges and be taken out of the running.
..My Trump, Kumbaya...
Does a single picture prove/disprove anything? Wouldn't polls/studies be more important?

Also even if the 'only racist straight sexist white hateful males are for Trump' claim wasn't true I doubt the left would drop it. Too comforting and convenient.

I've seen claims like 'minorities/women for trump have internalized self-hate'. Someone on the left might see that picture and not even recognize that these are thinking humans.
Hoping Trump will be their sugar daddy.  Especially guy in glasses.
https://m.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4aawkr/what_is_the_meaning_of_based/?ref=readnext_2
This is the same publication that put articles about Trump under "entertainment" when he first ran for President. Nothing at this point surprises when it comes to the Cuckington Post. 
Trump has had a very interesting life and done so many things it's pretty amazing how clean it is.
I wouldn't act like they think this is their "end all" piece of evidence. It's been what, a few days since Bezos team was announced? Who knows what else will come out. With that being said, I can't foresee a situation where Trump did anything involving corruption and espionage on a mass scale like you know who.
I don't think that it's so much that he's "clean" I think it's more that all his dirty laundry is out in the open that it's clear no one cares. Like how lyin' Ted was under a microscope for the mistress story? It was big news because it went against his character and was a scandal. Everyone already knows Trump had affairs, so why would you dig that up and attack him with it
Hes has the best affairs. 

>"Trump cheats on super model wife with dozens of other young attractive  super models"

And we're expected to admonish him.
Cheating on your spouse is reprehensible.  It doesn't suddenly become "okay" if the affair is with someone hot.  Monogamy and families are the basic unit of Western civilization.  

The reason not to admonish Trump isn't because he cheated with hot girls, it's because it's old news.  
So this is Amazon CEO Jeff Bozo's attack.

Edit: Here's the context: https://web.archive.org/web/20160512020119/http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/ 

TL;DR New dungeon boss Amazon CEO is trying to Stump the Trump by hiring 20 man dirt army. Owns Washington Post so he also controls the media. 
Being "good" at business is not the end all of business, that sort of thinking creates globalist monopolies...such as Amazon. I wonder why Amazon doesn't want Trump...could it be because they profit massively from bad free trade agreements?
Trump said it himself :ANTITRUST 
That's just business. Trump would do the same. Power moves. 
Ok? Doesn't mean I have to support a globalist corporation who is pushing against Trump.
Trump should point this out.
Would you say he needs to save his...

Trump Card?
In this case that person referred to Trump as a seperate person... but I like your style. 

If this is the best line of attack they can muster, Melania better get somebody to fly down to DC and start measuring drapes. 
##**BTFO**

Lol I just watched this tape. There isn't even proof that it's Trump- it doesn't even sound that much like him. Wtf were they thinking?
Its just bullshit. Liberal media will do this weekly now with any irrelevant bullshit they can find. To force him to have to answer their leading bullshit questions. And help their Marxist globalist queen Hillary. 

But it does not matter. They dont realize. Its a bad strategy. I mean, they have called him Hitler for 8 months. And he keeps moving forward! And he now is tied with her nationally, and has his own race won. While she is getting spanked by Bernie left and right and cant even secure her nomination. 

Nothing can saver her. NOt even media games. And in fact, this makes them look like bullshitters. Since everybody knows all the media is protecting her. 

Trump does not fall, much to their horror. He just keeps moving forward!

#Trump

#Rocky
Foolish Pope thinks that Smite Evil will work on Trump, but Trump's alignment is Chaotic Good. 
My feeling is that it was Trump trying to control the spin on his public persona. It's such a big "who gives a fuck?" kind of thing. He doesn't even saying anything mean about anyone. Does this compare in any way to fucking Hillary threatening Bill's rape victims, or lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation to gain money from foreign leaders? If this is the best Bezos got than Donald may as well start figuring out how he wants to decorate the Oval Office. 
Honestly. Even if this was Trump why the fuck would this be a reason I wouldn't vote for him? Everyone's done dumb shit and this is nothing compared to clintons scandals.
Trump was one of the original Jerky Boys!  We got em!
They're going to be throwing all kinds of shit at Trump's wall to see what sticks

It's just a continuation of the "Trump just disqualified himself" "The end of Trump" media memes... except they are now moving to the offense
It's a rumour that Trump used an alias and was actually his own PR person, a tactic he learned from his father. It's probably true but I don't think it's really that bad.
It just shows how fucking smart he is.

As a nobody, he also fast-talked his way into the top club in Manhattan through sheer force of will. The club president was a drunk which made it much easier, Trump said.

Trump literally bulldozed his way into the elite. They never wanted him. That's why saying he is one of them is functionally retarded.
The best part of that story is that the club owner was concerned Trump would steal all the hot wives of the other rich elite patrons.
Other celebrities use assumed names when they stay at the trump hotels to remain anonymous... Trump is so high energy he uses an assumed name so he can work a second job as his own employee. Fuck yes for America!

Good to know that "John Barron" would have answered the Benghazi phone call rather than crooked Hillary unable to rise from a white wine stupor.
Trump doesn't drink much anymore if any.  Since his brother passed away years ago.

Our Ambassadors and interests around the world can feel safe knowing that Trump will be answering the 3am phone call.  Not Hillary who will be sleeping in with a DO NOT DISTURB policy.
Can't recommend enough.  Picked up the Audio book and listen while in traffic.  Would clear up a lot of the confusion the  few #NeverTrumpers have.  The guy is an absolute madman and the first chapter narrating his phone calls with all types of people, even though he personally doesn't like but must work with to get something done.  

No sadly, Trump should remake that book with him and his kids narrating different chapters themselves.  

*Plane trip + audacity have it done in no time*

https://youtu.be/81yRpZXZdKk?t=2m44s
He doesn't even say anything crazy in it. He could have said he fucked Madonna but he doesn't. It's goofy but it's such a non-issue. Trump fill figure out a way for this not to stick. 
Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump

> http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/#9a6l7wRUBBbSMlEP.99

An audio recording from 25 years ago?  Trump is calling it a scam and what else are we to believe from MSM types who have [edited surveillance tapes](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/index.html) and pushed agendas for the last decade+?
Who saves that from 25 years ago and then be able to dig it up and assume it's Trump.

For all we know that could have been made yesterday by someone in Hillary's camp.
> the washington post

Then you are like who owns that paper?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos

CEO of Amazon. 

[Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump](http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/)
I thought Trump did use an alias and was actually his own PR person. His father also did the same thing from what I've read.
CNN is shilling this hard. Jake Tapper is saying that if Trump is lying about such a small matter, then he must be a huge liar about other, more important thing. 
lmao this is the best they got. An alleged 25 year old tape. Even it is The Donald, NOTHING CAN STUMP THIS MAN.

Those shillary autists are justifying her breaking federal law but this tape is the item that will end Trump.

They are so desperate. I'm glad he dealt with it and was like "Come on guys, can we please get to some more relevant shit - you can't stump the Trump." like a total alpha. Then the reporter falls in line (who is that Matt Bauer? idk I don't watch tv news anymore I just get most of my news from you amazing Pedes.) and starts talking about something more relevant and recent. Bam. I wonder if the media gets tired of being stumped all the time?
**Reporter:** "Oh hai, Mr. Trump, someone claims they went through your trash 20 years ago and they found a dirty napkin with the words 'I am a thief' written in what looks like your handwriting, can you please comment on this?"
**Trump:** "I know you're pandering to your cuck audience, but can we talk about grown up stuff?"

SAVAGE!
LOL. The traitors are getting so desperate. Poor Jeff Bozo of Amazon hates Trump. 

Has like **20** of his "journalist" whose only job now is to bullshit about Trump as much as they can. Since that paper also loves Obama, and Hillary. At least 20 is what was reported. They probably got more, all working in some dungeon 24/7, and muttering "we must get Trump, we must get Trump". "we are with her, we are with her, Hillary"

To force him to have to answer bullshit like this when he goes on these liberal shows with these "journalist". 

It will not stop him. When will you learn media. NOBODY likes you that much anymore. Both sides think you are garbage now. NObody really trust you that much. Most just see you as a Soap Opera of bullshit. 

#WashingtonPost

LMAO. I laugh at thee. 

Even toilet paper is more relevant, and useful than much of our media and what is considered "journalism" now. 

The more you attack him, the more people get fed up with so much of your bullshit.  

Of course, **#CrookedHillary** is just facing a casual "security inquiry" liberal media. Just like getting an anti virus check. Thats what the FBI is doing. Protect her all you can Media. People still hate her. And Trump will easily Schlong her.  
it's the same as the Bill DiBlasio ad that I've heard on radio in recent months that apparently tries to criticize Trump using an "audio recording of his own voice" but when you listen it sounds like someone already doing a bad voice impersonation and the pitch is too high. Liberals have no shame, and they will pull any trick to make you believe the other side is bad.
[Here's the full story with the full 15 minute video.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)

Frankly if this the best attack they have, they're going to lose. Trump making sure he gets the correct spin on his public persona doesn't really compare to Hillary lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation as a way to launder money, or threatening Bill's rape victims.
WTF man. Between this and that other interviewer who wouldn't drop the tax return bull shit. 

I can't wait until Trump is the next President and make them all look like complete idiots. 
Listened to the tape. Didn't hear anything particularly damning, but it does sound like Trump. Not so much in tone but how he speaks.
Honestly, this is almost definitely Trump. The accent is good, but it's unmistakably Trump's cadence, and Trumps NYC accent creeps in from time to time. I don't know why Trump's denying it - it's actually kind of funny.

The good news, though, is that this is apparently the worst dirt the media has been able to dig up on Trump. Sad!
He probably was mean to someone in one of these calls and figures it's best to deny the whole thing.

Let's compare: Trump probably lying about posing as his own publicist 25 years ago vs. Hillary trying to throw a filmmaker under the bus and blame him for violence/killings while lying to Benghazi victims' families.
LOL!

So this 25 year old prank call recording is the best they have to trash Trump with? Give me a break.
#**Lmao i dont doubt for a second it wasn't Donald Trump but this just makes me love him even more MAGA**
It's a totally hilarious radio interview of Trump pretending to be Trump's spokesman, explaining his then-current situation with women, real estate and maybe more I didn't hear.

This is definitely a guy that would be fun to have a beer with.

If the press can't get a legit smile out of it, they have no sense of humor.
WaPo Bezos vanity project, nobody can read it without retching. Story about phony call means nothing but intent is to trash Trump that he called under presumed name, no evidence. Worse than Tabloid which has true stories about Ted. Idiotic, phony hoax. Happens all the time to stupid news people. They just want to smear Trump with their boy reporter suspicions which are meaningless. He was a private person. What about the 20 years Obama spent with Rev Right and G-d America? Investigating Obama should be interesting such as his birth certificate. Where were they during Bengazi, those two incompetents, Hillary and Obama? Investigating Hillary should yield gold for the WaPo. Investigating Bill-ary and how she Enables the Energizer Bunny for Bill, who gives this rich divorcee bombshell Foundation money, that's juicy and it is relevant. Because like all the things Hillary does, it is ILLEGAL and provable.
As a New Yorker, the voices are clearly different.

If you can't tell, this is what Trump sounded like in 1991: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw

I'll concede the phrasing sounds like Trump, but it's either not him or he heavily toned down his intonation and speaking mannerisms. I've also heard Trump talk with a lower key on CNN over the phone and it still doesn't sound like the guy in the video.

Here's a more recent phone interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMwzElHMcHU

Of course, I could be wrong, because some excepts sound more like him than others, but if it was him, he was definitely masking it.
Trumps voice from 25 years ago was much higher pitched than it is now. I listened but I just don't think it was him. They probably heard that he did that and decided to try one out with an impersonator to see if they could pull it off. Anyway, it is so petty compared to all the email and other scandals.  
A kid on Watters World from Queens sounded just like Trump. This is 2016 and kids are born sounding like Trump. Should be a contest. Actually dishonest WaPo is asking for it. They will have thousands of John Millers pretending to be Trump pulling their legs.
if you're talking about the Apprentice, while Trump is in office Arnold Schwarzenegger will be hosting it 
Trump is an exception

While we are taking about brainwashed...how much internet and liberal media do you listen to that say a man like Trump is a war monger? When has he said he would start wars just for money?

I know your feel bro. I am spaniard and I has already redpilled my family about Trump. I showed them Stefan Molyneux' data and videos about Medial lies on Trump. [Pic related](http://imgur.com/8vl4HzN.jpg)

MEGA = MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN
I convinced my father, swayed my mom a little. Sister is a Berniebot and an SJW sadly.

She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans", and that "He ran a campaign based on serving the rich" and threw a tantrum and the room. Also said something about how voting republican is like the worst thing ever no matter what.

SJWism to a tee. Sadly for her it just convinced my father and mother that I was right.
> She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans"

He does, and he should.  He DOESN'T want to deport Americans.  And if you're an American, a citizen of the united states, you're not going anywhere.  If you're a Mexican, a citizen of MEXICO, and you didn't get permission to be here then you should absolutely get thrown the fuck out.
>She insisted that "He [Trump] ran a campaign based on serving the rich"

HAHAHAHA what? Trump has literally promised the exact opposite of that! It's half the reason he's so appealing to regular American!
Just remember that a lot of us liberals will be voting for Trump if Sanders doesn't get the nomination. We're not all bad!
>  Sister is a Berniebot and an SJW sadly.

My sister's 100% aboard the Trump train and despises the Dems. FeelsGoodMan

I've had a nice debate with my dorm neighbour last weekend

He seen me watching Trump on YT, and we talked for quite a bit (he was pro-hillary, but he told me he had no interest in elections - almost).

Now the good bit? He's pro-trump now, and we both agreed that this election is very thrilling to watch.

The bad one? I'm a Russian who lives in Czech Republic, he's CZ guy, so no votes from us. :(
I currently live in Germany with the family and the amount of Trump supporters here is just massively growing.

I think Hillary reminds them of Merkel. 
I went to dinner with my (legal) immigrant grandparents and father and they started talking about how much they love Trump. Good stuff.
As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

Proof: the 2008 recession which most european countries are still feeling the effects of.

It's hard to admit, but the world depends on the us as much as the us depends on the rest of the world.
> As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

I wish the rest of the world recognized this truth!
Yeah I keep trying to convince my parents that Trump is a God Emperor, but in the end it doesn't really matter. 
Oooo attempts at diverting.

Impossible that a Trump sub, of all the reddit possibilities is the only one you like.

It's just, if you're actually American and lying, you're doing more harm than good. If you're European with some odd obsession, than do more to prove it, please.

hahahahaha. I'm trying SO hard to convert my sister, since she's one of those 'Trump is racist' robots. Not really working :/ but still lots of fun to fight with these types of people in person. 

She wants Canada to accept more refugees. She doesn't really work and her husband supports her.... I asked her why don't they sponsor a refugee family if they want to help them so much. And she was like 'no that's not my job, it's the government's". LOGIC 

Sadly, she's ready to support her American friends in whatever way she can if they decide to move to Canada after Trump wins. >_____>
It's sad. Really sad, to see my gender act this way.

A few years ago I would have been triggered by your typical woman comment. But after the refugee crisis and Trump, my eyes are open to how irrational and ignorant a lot of women are.  All the women in my life lack reason. My sister calls herself a feminist and openly hates on men, who have supported her and given her a life of comfort. She does not recognize their struggles or suffering at all, I have tried to reason with her. But all our arguments end up with her running away, or crying or her saying "I'M RIGHT. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE OLDER"

Well, I'm nearing 30 and I still don't understand their logic.   
thanks! ^_^ haha. yeah I know all women are not like that. I'll meet some good ones someday. My sister does have a friend who is a Trump supporter. My sister regularly threatens to unfriend her and I kindly remind her it's ridiculous to unfriend someone because of a difference of opinion.  

my bf is a reasonable man. he constantly challenges my ideas (in other words MISOGYNY), and I'm better because of that constant exchange. I am so grateful I didn't end up with some cuck
Trump does not see race sex gender all that bullshit. He sees potential and how good their work is, and pays accordingly.
Trump should retweet it
What's funny is that Trump admited that there was unequal pay in his organization, but it favored women, absolutely no media blowback because it hurts Hillarys narrative.
The Hillary sub actually thinks this was a good negative ad that shows how sexist Trump is. 

Hahaha Jesus Christ these people live on a different planet. They don't want equal anything, that want special everything!

MAGA - Trump 2016


He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
#THIS IS WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT TRUMP.#

I've been saying this for months now to friends and family that what I love most about Trump is he is UNAPOLOGETICLY himself. He doesn't apologize for trying to pay as little as he can. It's such a breath of fresh fucking air.  
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4j5xrh/donald_trump_denies_washington_post_audio_full/
They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

**Our media are our enemy now. Most of it is garbage. And most of them are liberal marxist globalist snake pieces of shit. Not journalist anymore. But professional race baiters, bullshitters, and manipulators.**

Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.

Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.

Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
How embarrassing. You can hear the desperation in his voice trying to nail Trump on his tax returns and then actually trying to defend Hillary for her missing emails.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
I was a trump supporter (small t) prior to this morning, but what the hell just happened on GMA this morning made me a Mega TRUMP supporter.  Finally a man that has something hanging between his legs and can tell it how it is, not that he has not been doing this all along, but hey, way to shut up snuffaluffagas.  You have my vote Mr Trump.
His ability to get up and just say wtf we are all thinking is my favorite part about him. 

Reporter: Your tax returns may show that you pay a low tax rate 

Trump: I fight very hard to pay as little in taxes as possible and I've openly been saying that for 2 years, they waste our money and throw it down the drain. 


Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
I can't believe Stepnfetchitopolous tried to Stump The Trump. 
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Trump is fearless.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
Even if Trump is in the clear with the tax issues, and he is actually waiting for the audit to end, this makes him look bad. It is one of the few things that Hillary has got against him, even though it is nothing serious. The fact that they keep saying he hasn't released them is not a good viewpoint for Trump. Never will the media call Hillary out for her crimes, her crimes in Benghazi, her threats and maybe even murders of past people in the "clinton circle", or the threats to bill's former women, but they will never speak a word. But for Trump, they will make him seem like a criminal for not releasing his tax info yet. 
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Doesn't need to say anything, the hard core believers take anything said about trump negatively.

Trump pets a puppy

Oh no trump hates kittens
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
Her daughter said that she is a fake, a slob, neglectful parent. And also that she abandoned her and did not help her during a drug  problem. But Rosie thought Trump was evil for giving Miss America another chance with her drug problem.

And Rosie calls Trump the evil one almost weekly. Of course, it is Trump that has 5 loving, loyal, humble, kind, not druggies,  well adjusted, and the older ones completely successful children. 

I have not heard about the alocoholism. But if i remember her daughter did say  Rosie drinks a lot of beer daily. 
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
Every single ad I've seen Hillary put out vs. Trump is an emotional appeal, totally devoid of either criticism of his policies or touting her own plans.  It all boils down to "WAAAAAAA!"
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Shit's like dissing Dre. You try to stump Trump you just stump yo'self.
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
Trump should retweet it.
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
Well, the implication of what Trump said is that women in general *aren't* doing as good a job as men (as evidenced by the fact they are paid less). And that's kind of an offensive thing to say.
Hills on the Trump Train now!
But...seriously.  Trump basically said 'Equal Pay for Equal Work' and they try to say 'look, look!  What a bad guy!'
The debate writes itself!

Hillary: And Donald Trump's sexist remarks cannot stand! He says women will make the same pay if they do the same job!

Everybody: ....and?

And jesus, that tweet:

-Trump says women will get equal pay for equal work

-Trump cherishes women

-Time to believe what Trump says

Savage?
It was probably done by their professional chef to make sure it looks perfect. Under Trump we should train all cooks to be chefs. 

**Make Our Food Great Again**
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thank you. You'd be doing us and yourself a favor by sharing my story with your friends who may be against the idea of Trump. This sentence sums it up: Either you're for Trump, or you hate America.
We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
Thank you so much, I (we) really appreciate that. I hope you share my story with your friends, especially if they're against Trump. That man is a blessing from the heavens. Without him we'd be stuck with establishment assholes who only want to Globalize the world into misery. 
Asylum because religious persecution by muslims in Bosnia. We're catholic. As soon as these snakes have the majority, it's game over.

Three big reasons why I'm voting for Trump:

* Illegal immigration needs to stop

* Muslims should not be taken in by the thousands (they're not our friends, believe me)

* Gun rights
#Your *WALL* is evolving!

This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.
[watch the short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Y7cA8w6Hk)

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
> Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

What program?

What program?

The war on drugs? Heavy prison sentences?
That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs. 
Mccain got 3, Romney gets 7, Trump gets 13. 
That will help Trump's push into the rust belt and northeast. Romney list every damn state North and East of Kentucky
#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.
Status:

Libtards: Stumped

Bernie Bots: Cucked

Clinton Shills: Crooked

Brakes: Failed

Trump Train: Ahead of Schedule
Trump: Ascended God
I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
The problem is the media, activists and the politicians have fooled themselves into believing Hispanics are one homogeneous group or race of people that can be controlled politically.That ignorance will cost the Dems votes and Trump will do better than everyone is expecting with Hispanic voters.
I am confused and could have sworn he wouldn't win this demographic. Can someone explain to me why Hispanic voters are backing Trump?
Because polls consistently show Trump has Hispanic disapproval at around 80%. I love the man but there's no way this poll is accurate.

Crime is the disease. Trump is the cure.
Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character. One of them takes a nuanced approach and pokes fun at himself during it, while the other gets on a soapbox about refugees. I guarantee none of those refugees will be anywhere near his mountainside mansion in Italy.  
> Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character.

"We will not be governed by fear" said the nervous man failing to form coherent sentences while he attempts to create mass hysteria over patriotism.
As they do nothing but try to make people fearful of a Trump presidency.  They are everything that they rail against.  
For having made a career glorifying gun violence, Stallone is *massively* anti-gun. He has, publicly, advocated for door-to-door confiscation of all guns. Great that he's pro-Trump, but I have a hard time applying positive terms to the guy.
Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.
Anyone have a for/against(empty threat to leave the country) Trump list of celebrities?
[**Trump to Hillary**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygQvB6OjHOU)
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
what you call management I call omniscience. If you knew exactly when to sell and exactly when to buy then I agree you could get more than 7% growth by transferring wealth from others to yourself. Donald Trump got ~40% growth by creating wealth.
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
According to who? or what criteria? 

Trump's doing pretty well, wouldn't you say? Would you agree he's at least doing *okay* as far as his financial situation goes?
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING.

It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.

tired of this cuck trying to bandwagon off of the glorious leader Trump
ah yeah,,,that exactly the point to reach a bigger audience and start uncucking people and simply not engagins is starting to not work just like demonizing people isnt, perfect example 

#Lord God Emperor Trump 
For a blue state, I've gotten a lot of supportive comments when I wear my Trump hoodie around in NY. Always in the doctor's office though I get a bunch of thumbs up and things, loooot of doctors seem to love him.
The opposition has used fear and shaming to play against the psyche of the population. That's why you saw Trump winning almost anywhere there was a real election while the caucuses lent more towards Cruz or another candidate, being more socially accepted to voice in front of your neighbors. 
I'm going to see Rob Zombie this Sunday, and I'm going to be wearing my Trump shirt and MAGA hat.
Fuck the Berniebots that have an issue. I try to wear my Cameron Lee High Energy hat with a Trump shirt (I have every color) all weekend in public in NY. I do get sketched out about restaurants though, I fear fluid contamination.
That's a great shirt, I was looking km Trump's website and I couldn't find that particular shirt. Could you link me to where you found it??
That Orlando and Central Florida area will be critical for Trump. It's been traditionally red with the space program and all their D.o.D. contracting. That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
Serious question:

I'm a patriot living abroad as a digital nomad. I want some Trump merch because it's awesome and would make some of these euro's salty as fuck, but Trump doesn't ship over seas.

What do I need to do to get some God Emperor material?
If you want the official Donald J Trump made in America shirts off his website, I'm sure one of us centipedes could receive it and send it to you. 
Aliexpress sell Trump stuff.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
Assuming it's Disneyland, then you're actually really brave. Hell as someone who lives in OC I'd never get a Trump bumper sticker on my car because the odds of me going to cities like Santa Ana and having it unscathed or even me not getting harassed are low.
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.
Holy fucking shit I could get hundreds more people to vote for him if he did this.

Trump = Big Boss?

Also, Huey sounds eerily similar to Hillary. Just saying.
President Trump and Kojima will show konami "big league", generating the highest sales ever seen!
>"How exactly will he MAGA? He doesn't ever say how."

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial. 
American wide summer sales. Free games when you do your taxes. Possibilities are endless. 

Trump/Gaben 2016 
Trump: under my presidency, Ubisoft will never be able to release a bad port again, and when they downgrade the graphics, there will be consequences, BUH-LIEVE ME 
Obama brought back arrested development. If Trump can HL3, I'll MAGA. 
He shouldnt have to say how. He's Donald Trump. Making things great is literaly what he does all day. He cant help but makes things great.
Just winning the presidency and not hating America would be a huge improvement over "I have an interesting voice so no more freedom, **folks**".

When Trump is the Lord Captain Commander, hopefully he'll be able to scrub clean the word folks so that it can be used by normal lads again.
That's a good rule actually. If it wasn't there Trump could be arrested on false charges and be taken out of the running.
..My Trump, Kumbaya...
Does a single picture prove/disprove anything? Wouldn't polls/studies be more important?

Also even if the 'only racist straight sexist white hateful males are for Trump' claim wasn't true I doubt the left would drop it. Too comforting and convenient.

I've seen claims like 'minorities/women for trump have internalized self-hate'. Someone on the left might see that picture and not even recognize that these are thinking humans.
Hoping Trump will be their sugar daddy.  Especially guy in glasses.
https://m.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4aawkr/what_is_the_meaning_of_based/?ref=readnext_2
This is the same publication that put articles about Trump under "entertainment" when he first ran for President. Nothing at this point surprises when it comes to the Cuckington Post. 
Trump does not see race sex gender all that bullshit. He sees potential and how good their work is, and pays accordingly.
Trump should retweet it
What's funny is that Trump admited that there was unequal pay in his organization, but it favored women, absolutely no media blowback because it hurts Hillarys narrative.
The Hillary sub actually thinks this was a good negative ad that shows how sexist Trump is. 

Hahaha Jesus Christ these people live on a different planet. They don't want equal anything, that want special everything!
Trump has had a very interesting life and done so many things it's pretty amazing how clean it is.
I wouldn't act like they think this is their "end all" piece of evidence. It's been what, a few days since Bezos team was announced? Who knows what else will come out. With that being said, I can't foresee a situation where Trump did anything involving corruption and espionage on a mass scale like you know who.
I don't think that it's so much that he's "clean" I think it's more that all his dirty laundry is out in the open that it's clear no one cares. Like how lyin' Ted was under a microscope for the mistress story? It was big news because it went against his character and was a scandal. Everyone already knows Trump had affairs, so why would you dig that up and attack him with it
Hes has the best affairs. 

>"Trump cheats on super model wife with dozens of other young attractive  super models"

And we're expected to admonish him.
Cheating on your spouse is reprehensible.  It doesn't suddenly become "okay" if the affair is with someone hot.  Monogamy and families are the basic unit of Western civilization.  

The reason not to admonish Trump isn't because he cheated with hot girls, it's because it's old news.  
So this is Amazon CEO Jeff Bozo's attack.

Edit: Here's the context: https://web.archive.org/web/20160512020119/http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/ 

TL;DR New dungeon boss Amazon CEO is trying to Stump the Trump by hiring 20 man dirt army. Owns Washington Post so he also controls the media. 
Being "good" at business is not the end all of business, that sort of thinking creates globalist monopolies...such as Amazon. I wonder why Amazon doesn't want Trump...could it be because they profit massively from bad free trade agreements?
Trump said it himself :ANTITRUST 
That's just business. Trump would do the same. Power moves. 
Ok? Doesn't mean I have to support a globalist corporation who is pushing against Trump.
Trump should point this out.
Would you say he needs to save his...

Trump Card?
In this case that person referred to Trump as a seperate person... but I like your style. 

If this is the best line of attack they can muster, Melania better get somebody to fly down to DC and start measuring drapes. 
##**BTFO**

Lol I just watched this tape. There isn't even proof that it's Trump- it doesn't even sound that much like him. Wtf were they thinking?
Its just bullshit. Liberal media will do this weekly now with any irrelevant bullshit they can find. To force him to have to answer their leading bullshit questions. And help their Marxist globalist queen Hillary. 

But it does not matter. They dont realize. Its a bad strategy. I mean, they have called him Hitler for 8 months. And he keeps moving forward! And he now is tied with her nationally, and has his own race won. While she is getting spanked by Bernie left and right and cant even secure her nomination. 

Nothing can saver her. NOt even media games. And in fact, this makes them look like bullshitters. Since everybody knows all the media is protecting her. 

Trump does not fall, much to their horror. He just keeps moving forward!

#Trump

#Rocky
Foolish Pope thinks that Smite Evil will work on Trump, but Trump's alignment is Chaotic Good. 
My feeling is that it was Trump trying to control the spin on his public persona. It's such a big "who gives a fuck?" kind of thing. He doesn't even saying anything mean about anyone. Does this compare in any way to fucking Hillary threatening Bill's rape victims, or lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation to gain money from foreign leaders? If this is the best Bezos got than Donald may as well start figuring out how he wants to decorate the Oval Office. 
Honestly. Even if this was Trump why the fuck would this be a reason I wouldn't vote for him? Everyone's done dumb shit and this is nothing compared to clintons scandals.
Trump was one of the original Jerky Boys!  We got em!
They're going to be throwing all kinds of shit at Trump's wall to see what sticks

It's just a continuation of the "Trump just disqualified himself" "The end of Trump" media memes... except they are now moving to the offense
It's a rumour that Trump used an alias and was actually his own PR person, a tactic he learned from his father. It's probably true but I don't think it's really that bad.
It just shows how fucking smart he is.

As a nobody, he also fast-talked his way into the top club in Manhattan through sheer force of will. The club president was a drunk which made it much easier, Trump said.

Trump literally bulldozed his way into the elite. They never wanted him. That's why saying he is one of them is functionally retarded.
The best part of that story is that the club owner was concerned Trump would steal all the hot wives of the other rich elite patrons.
Other celebrities use assumed names when they stay at the trump hotels to remain anonymous... Trump is so high energy he uses an assumed name so he can work a second job as his own employee. Fuck yes for America!

Good to know that "John Barron" would have answered the Benghazi phone call rather than crooked Hillary unable to rise from a white wine stupor.
Trump doesn't drink much anymore if any.  Since his brother passed away years ago.

Our Ambassadors and interests around the world can feel safe knowing that Trump will be answering the 3am phone call.  Not Hillary who will be sleeping in with a DO NOT DISTURB policy.
Can't recommend enough.  Picked up the Audio book and listen while in traffic.  Would clear up a lot of the confusion the  few #NeverTrumpers have.  The guy is an absolute madman and the first chapter narrating his phone calls with all types of people, even though he personally doesn't like but must work with to get something done.  

No sadly, Trump should remake that book with him and his kids narrating different chapters themselves.  

*Plane trip + audacity have it done in no time*

He doesn't even say anything crazy in it. He could have said he fucked Madonna but he doesn't. It's goofy but it's such a non-issue. Trump fill figure out a way for this not to stick. 
Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump

An audio recording from 25 years ago?  Trump is calling it a scam and what else are we to believe from MSM types who have [edited surveillance tapes](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/index.html) and pushed agendas for the last decade+?
Who saves that from 25 years ago and then be able to dig it up and assume it's Trump.

For all we know that could have been made yesterday by someone in Hillary's camp.
> the washington post

Then you are like who owns that paper?

CEO of Amazon. 

[Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump](http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/)
I thought Trump did use an alias and was actually his own PR person. His father also did the same thing from what I've read.
CNN is shilling this hard. Jake Tapper is saying that if Trump is lying about such a small matter, then he must be a huge liar about other, more important thing. 
lmao this is the best they got. An alleged 25 year old tape. Even it is The Donald, NOTHING CAN STUMP THIS MAN.

Those shillary autists are justifying her breaking federal law but this tape is the item that will end Trump.

They are so desperate. I'm glad he dealt with it and was like "Come on guys, can we please get to some more relevant shit - you can't stump the Trump." like a total alpha. Then the reporter falls in line (who is that Matt Bauer? idk I don't watch tv news anymore I just get most of my news from you amazing Pedes.) and starts talking about something more relevant and recent. Bam. I wonder if the media gets tired of being stumped all the time?
**Reporter:** "Oh hai, Mr. Trump, someone claims they went through your trash 20 years ago and they found a dirty napkin with the words 'I am a thief' written in what looks like your handwriting, can you please comment on this?"
**Trump:** "I know you're pandering to your cuck audience, but can we talk about grown up stuff?"

SAVAGE!
LOL. The traitors are getting so desperate. Poor Jeff Bozo of Amazon hates Trump. 

Has like **20** of his "journalist" whose only job now is to bullshit about Trump as much as they can. Since that paper also loves Obama, and Hillary. At least 20 is what was reported. They probably got more, all working in some dungeon 24/7, and muttering "we must get Trump, we must get Trump". "we are with her, we are with her, Hillary"

To force him to have to answer bullshit like this when he goes on these liberal shows with these "journalist". 

It will not stop him. When will you learn media. NOBODY likes you that much anymore. Both sides think you are garbage now. NObody really trust you that much. Most just see you as a Soap Opera of bullshit. 

#WashingtonPost

LMAO. I laugh at thee. 

Even toilet paper is more relevant, and useful than much of our media and what is considered "journalism" now. 

The more you attack him, the more people get fed up with so much of your bullshit.  

Of course, **#CrookedHillary** is just facing a casual "security inquiry" liberal media. Just like getting an anti virus check. Thats what the FBI is doing. Protect her all you can Media. People still hate her. And Trump will easily Schlong her.  
it's the same as the Bill DiBlasio ad that I've heard on radio in recent months that apparently tries to criticize Trump using an "audio recording of his own voice" but when you listen it sounds like someone already doing a bad voice impersonation and the pitch is too high. Liberals have no shame, and they will pull any trick to make you believe the other side is bad.
[Here's the full story with the full 15 minute video.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)

Frankly if this the best attack they have, they're going to lose. Trump making sure he gets the correct spin on his public persona doesn't really compare to Hillary lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation as a way to launder money, or threatening Bill's rape victims.
WTF man. Between this and that other interviewer who wouldn't drop the tax return bull shit. 

I can't wait until Trump is the next President and make them all look like complete idiots. 
Listened to the tape. Didn't hear anything particularly damning, but it does sound like Trump. Not so much in tone but how he speaks.
Honestly, this is almost definitely Trump. The accent is good, but it's unmistakably Trump's cadence, and Trumps NYC accent creeps in from time to time. I don't know why Trump's denying it - it's actually kind of funny.

The good news, though, is that this is apparently the worst dirt the media has been able to dig up on Trump. Sad!
He probably was mean to someone in one of these calls and figures it's best to deny the whole thing.

Let's compare: Trump probably lying about posing as his own publicist 25 years ago vs. Hillary trying to throw a filmmaker under the bus and blame him for violence/killings while lying to Benghazi victims' families.
LOL!

So this 25 year old prank call recording is the best they have to trash Trump with? Give me a break.
#**Lmao i dont doubt for a second it wasn't Donald Trump but this just makes me love him even more MAGA**
It's a totally hilarious radio interview of Trump pretending to be Trump's spokesman, explaining his then-current situation with women, real estate and maybe more I didn't hear.

This is definitely a guy that would be fun to have a beer with.

If the press can't get a legit smile out of it, they have no sense of humor.
WaPo Bezos vanity project, nobody can read it without retching. Story about phony call means nothing but intent is to trash Trump that he called under presumed name, no evidence. Worse than Tabloid which has true stories about Ted. Idiotic, phony hoax. Happens all the time to stupid news people. They just want to smear Trump with their boy reporter suspicions which are meaningless. He was a private person. What about the 20 years Obama spent with Rev Right and G-d America? Investigating Obama should be interesting such as his birth certificate. Where were they during Bengazi, those two incompetents, Hillary and Obama? Investigating Hillary should yield gold for the WaPo. Investigating Bill-ary and how she Enables the Energizer Bunny for Bill, who gives this rich divorcee bombshell Foundation money, that's juicy and it is relevant. Because like all the things Hillary does, it is ILLEGAL and provable.
As a New Yorker, the voices are clearly different.

If you can't tell, this is what Trump sounded like in 1991: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw

I'll concede the phrasing sounds like Trump, but it's either not him or he heavily toned down his intonation and speaking mannerisms. I've also heard Trump talk with a lower key on CNN over the phone and it still doesn't sound like the guy in the video.

Here's a more recent phone interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMwzElHMcHU

Of course, I could be wrong, because some excepts sound more like him than others, but if it was him, he was definitely masking it.
Trumps voice from 25 years ago was much higher pitched than it is now. I listened but I just don't think it was him. They probably heard that he did that and decided to try one out with an impersonator to see if they could pull it off. Anyway, it is so petty compared to all the email and other scandals.  
A kid on Watters World from Queens sounded just like Trump. This is 2016 and kids are born sounding like Trump. Should be a contest. Actually dishonest WaPo is asking for it. They will have thousands of John Millers pretending to be Trump pulling their legs.
Trumpisim is going to shake up global politics, we are right to be excited

I know your feel bro. I am spaniard and I has already redpilled my family about Trump. I showed them Stefan Molyneux' data and videos about Medial lies on Trump. [Pic related](http://imgur.com/8vl4HzN.jpg)

MEGA = MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN
I convinced my father, swayed my mom a little. Sister is a Berniebot and an SJW sadly.

She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans", and that "He ran a campaign based on serving the rich" and threw a tantrum and the room. Also said something about how voting republican is like the worst thing ever no matter what.

SJWism to a tee. Sadly for her it just convinced my father and mother that I was right.
> She insisted Trump wants to "Deport all Mexicans"

He does, and he should.  He DOESN'T want to deport Americans.  And if you're an American, a citizen of the united states, you're not going anywhere.  If you're a Mexican, a citizen of MEXICO, and you didn't get permission to be here then you should absolutely get thrown the fuck out.
>She insisted that "He [Trump] ran a campaign based on serving the rich"

HAHAHAHA what? Trump has literally promised the exact opposite of that! It's half the reason he's so appealing to regular American!
Just remember that a lot of us liberals will be voting for Trump if Sanders doesn't get the nomination. We're not all bad!
>  Sister is a Berniebot and an SJW sadly.

I've had a nice debate with my dorm neighbour last weekend

He seen me watching Trump on YT, and we talked for quite a bit (he was pro-hillary, but he told me he had no interest in elections - almost).

Now the good bit? He's pro-trump now, and we both agreed that this election is very thrilling to watch.

The bad one? I'm a Russian who lives in Czech Republic, he's CZ guy, so no votes from us. :(
I currently live in Germany with the family and the amount of Trump supporters here is just massively growing.

I think Hillary reminds them of Merkel. 
I went to dinner with my (legal) immigrant grandparents and father and they started talking about how much they love Trump. Good stuff.
As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

Proof: the 2008 recession which most european countries are still feeling the effects of.

It's hard to admit, but the world depends on the us as much as the us depends on the rest of the world.
> As an european I want Trump to win because if the US does good so does the rest of the world, if the US does poorly... so does the rest of the world.

I wish the rest of the world recognized this truth!
Yeah I keep trying to convince my parents that Trump is a God Emperor, but in the end it doesn't really matter. 
hahahahaha. I'm trying SO hard to convert my sister, since she's one of those 'Trump is racist' robots. Not really working :/ but still lots of fun to fight with these types of people in person. 

She wants Canada to accept more refugees. She doesn't really work and her husband supports her.... I asked her why don't they sponsor a refugee family if they want to help them so much. And she was like 'no that's not my job, it's the government's". LOGIC 

Sadly, she's ready to support her American friends in whatever way she can if they decide to move to Canada after Trump wins. >_____>
It's sad. Really sad, to see my gender act this way.

A few years ago I would have been triggered by your typical woman comment. But after the refugee crisis and Trump, my eyes are open to how irrational and ignorant a lot of women are.  All the women in my life lack reason. My sister calls herself a feminist and openly hates on men, who have supported her and given her a life of comfort. She does not recognize their struggles or suffering at all, I have tried to reason with her. But all our arguments end up with her running away, or crying or her saying "I'M RIGHT. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE OLDER"

Well, I'm nearing 30 and I still don't understand their logic.   
thanks! ^_^ haha. yeah I know all women are not like that. I'll meet some good ones someday. My sister does have a friend who is a Trump supporter. My sister regularly threatens to unfriend her and I kindly remind her it's ridiculous to unfriend someone because of a difference of opinion.  

my bf is a reasonable man. he constantly challenges my ideas (in other words MISOGYNY), and I'm better because of that constant exchange. I am so grateful I didn't end up with some cuck
Oooo attempts at diverting.

Impossible that a Trump sub, of all the reddit possibilities is the only one you like.

It's just, if you're actually American and lying, you're doing more harm than good. If you're European with some odd obsession, than do more to prove it, please.

I think it also has something to do with Robin Williams holding a special place in my heart and that song being one of my favorite Disney songs if not my absolute favorite. I like to think if he was still around he would do great imitations of Trump and $hillary.

Besides all that, the song is a great choice for this parody since in the original lyrics there's literally a line that says, "Brush up your Sunday salaam."

Trump is the Shakespeare of twitter, every 140 character reply is an instant classic. 
Yes Jeb, Trump is going to insult the criminal establishment of the way to the Whitehouse. 
The Onion was bought out by major Hillary investors. They probably think this is an attack and will hurt Trump.
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
Every single ad I've seen Hillary put out vs. Trump is an emotional appeal, totally devoid of either criticism of his policies or touting her own plans.  It all boils down to "WAAAAAAA!"
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
And I think the corollary to that is:

She's trying to say Trump is wrong about that supposed sentiment, and pay is still somehow disparate between men and women, and therefore affirmative steps need to be taken which favor women because despite equivalent competency women still can't break this fictitious ceiling that some people perceive.

Of course that is all pandering BS and she probably is entirely incapable of intelligently deciphering the real economic labor factors in play.
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Doesn't need to say anything, the hard core believers take anything said about trump negatively.

Trump pets a puppy

Oh no trump hates kittens
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
Her daughter said that she is a fake, a slob, neglectful parent. And also that she abandoned her and did not help her during a drug  problem. But Rosie thought Trump was evil for giving Miss America another chance with her drug problem.

And Rosie calls Trump the evil one almost weekly. Of course, it is Trump that has 5 loving, loyal, humble, kind, not druggies,  well adjusted, and the older ones completely successful children. 

I have not heard about the alocoholism. But if i remember her daughter did say  Rosie drinks a lot of beer daily. 
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Shit's like dissing Dre. You try to stump Trump you just stump yo'self.
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
Trump should retweet it.
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
Donald Trump believes in equal rights for women and Hillary thinks that women should have more equality than that.
Well, the implication of what Trump said is that women in general *aren't* doing as good a job as men (as evidenced by the fact they are paid less). And that's kind of an offensive thing to say.
Hills on the Trump Train now!
But...seriously.  Trump basically said 'Equal Pay for Equal Work' and they try to say 'look, look!  What a bad guy!'
The debate writes itself!

Hillary: And Donald Trump's sexist remarks cannot stand! He says women will make the same pay if they do the same job!

Everybody: ....and?

And jesus, that tweet:

-Trump says women will get equal pay for equal work

-Trump cherishes women

-Time to believe what Trump says

Savage?
The DNC may just go with Bernie seeing how Trump is already dominating Clinton. 
It was probably done by their professional chef to make sure it looks perfect. Under Trump we should train all cooks to be chefs. 

**Make Our Food Great Again**
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thank you. You'd be doing us and yourself a favor by sharing my story with your friends who may be against the idea of Trump. This sentence sums it up: Either you're for Trump, or you hate America.
We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
Thank you so much, I (we) really appreciate that. I hope you share my story with your friends, especially if they're against Trump. That man is a blessing from the heavens. Without him we'd be stuck with establishment assholes who only want to Globalize the world into misery. 
Asylum because religious persecution by muslims in Bosnia. We're catholic. As soon as these snakes have the majority, it's game over.

Three big reasons why I'm voting for Trump:

* Illegal immigration needs to stop

* Muslims should not be taken in by the thousands (they're not our friends, believe me)

* Gun rights

This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
> Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

What program?

>He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.

The war on drugs? Heavy prison sentences?

That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs. 
Mccain got 3, Romney gets 7, Trump gets 13. 
That will help Trump's push into the rust belt and northeast. Romney list every damn state North and East of Kentucky
#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.
Status:

Libtards: Stumped

Bernie Bots: Cucked

Clinton Shills: Crooked

I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
 Even with like 20 percent and the increased white vote Trump can win easily.  I predict he will get about 15-20 percent of the black vote as well
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
The problem is the media, activists and the politicians have fooled themselves into believing Hispanics are one homogeneous group or race of people that can be controlled politically.That ignorance will cost the Dems votes and Trump will do better than everyone is expecting with Hispanic voters.
I am confused and could have sworn he wouldn't win this demographic. Can someone explain to me why Hispanic voters are backing Trump?
Because polls consistently show Trump has Hispanic disapproval at around 80%. I love the man but there's no way this poll is accurate.

Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character. One of them takes a nuanced approach and pokes fun at himself during it, while the other gets on a soapbox about refugees. I guarantee none of those refugees will be anywhere near his mountainside mansion in Italy.

For having made a career glorifying gun violence, Stallone is *massively* anti-gun. He has, publicly, advocated for door-to-door confiscation of all guns. Great that he's pro-Trump, but I have a hard time applying positive terms to the guy.
Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.

MAGA - Trump 2016


He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
Problem is the journalist doesn't realize Trump is the God Emperor. When he prays to God, Trump hears it.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4j5xrh/donald_trump_denies_washington_post_audio_full/
They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxaKUo5naoY

Or show you this:

**Our media are our enemy now. Most of it is garbage. And most of them are liberal marxist globalist snake pieces of shit. Not journalist anymore. But professional race baiters, bullshitters, and manipulators.** 
Before the end of my life I must make a pilgrimage to Trump Tower and partake in the World's Greatest Taco Bowls.

#TRUMP TACO BOWL > JEB! GUAC BOWLE
Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.  

**Trump steel won't bend or break.**
#MAGA
Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.
Pretty sure this is gonna end up on a Can't Stump The Trump video
Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
How embarrassing. You can hear the desperation in his voice trying to nail Trump on his tax returns and then actually trying to defend Hillary for her missing emails.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
I was a trump supporter (small t) prior to this morning, but what the hell just happened on GMA this morning made me a Mega TRUMP supporter.  Finally a man that has something hanging between his legs and can tell it how it is, not that he has not been doing this all along, but hey, way to shut up snuffaluffagas.  You have my vote Mr Trump.
His ability to get up and just say wtf we are all thinking is my favorite part about him. 

Reporter: Your tax returns may show that you pay a low tax rate 

Trump: I fight very hard to pay as little in taxes as possible and I've openly been saying that for 2 years, they waste our money and throw it down the drain. 


Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
I can't believe Stepnfetchitopolous tried to Stump The Trump. 
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Trump is fearless.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
Even if Trump is in the clear with the tax issues, and he is actually waiting for the audit to end, this makes him look bad. It is one of the few things that Hillary has got against him, even though it is nothing serious. The fact that they keep saying he hasn't released them is not a good viewpoint for Trump. Never will the media call Hillary out for her crimes, her crimes in Benghazi, her threats and maybe even murders of past people in the "clinton circle", or the threats to bill's former women, but they will never speak a word. But for Trump, they will make him seem like a criminal for not releasing his tax info yet. 
Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
what you call management I call omniscience. If you knew exactly when to sell and exactly when to buy then I agree you could get more than 7% growth by transferring wealth from others to yourself. Donald Trump got ~30% growth by creating wealth.
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
According to who? or what criteria? 

Trump's doing pretty well, wouldn't you say? Would you agree he's at least doing *okay* as far as his financial situation goes?
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING.

It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.

For a blue state, I've gotten a lot of supportive comments when I wear my Trump hoodie around in NY. Always in the doctor's office though I get a bunch of thumbs up and things, loooot of doctors seem to love him.
The opposition has used fear and shaming to play against the psyche of the population. That's why you saw Trump winning almost anywhere there was a real election while the caucuses lent more towards Cruz or another candidate, being more socially accepted to voice in front of your neighbors. 
I'm going to see Rob Zombie this Sunday, and I'm going to be wearing my Trump shirt and MAGA hat.
Fuck the Berniebots that have an issue. I try to wear my Cameron Lee High Energy hat with a Trump shirt (I have every color) all weekend in public in NY. I do get sketched out about restaurants though, I fear fluid contamination.
That's a great shirt, I was looking km Trump's website and I couldn't find that particular shirt. Could you link me to where you found it??
That Orlando and Central Florida area will be critical for Trump. It's been traditionally red with the space program and all their D.o.D. contracting. That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
Serious question:

I'm a patriot living abroad as a digital nomad. I want some Trump merch because it's awesome and would make some of these euro's salty as fuck, but Trump doesn't ship over seas.

What do I need to do to get some God Emperor material?
If you want the official Donald J Trump made in America shirts off his website, I'm sure one of us centipedes could receive it and send it to you. 
Aliexpress sell Trump stuff.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
Assuming it's Disneyland, then you're actually really brave. Hell as someone who lives in OC I'd never get a Trump bumper sticker on my car because the odds of me going to cities like Santa Ana and having it unscathed or even me not getting harassed are low.
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.
tired of this cuck trying to bandwagon off of the glorious leader Trump
ah yeah,,,that exactly the point to reach a bigger audience and start uncucking people and simply not engagins is starting to not work just like demonizing people isnt, perfect example 

#Lord God Emperor Trump 
Holy fucking shit I could get hundreds more people to vote for him if he did this.

Trump = Big Boss?

Also, Huey sounds eerily similar to Hillary. Just saying.
President Trump and Kojima will show konami "big league", generating the highest sales ever seen!
>"How exactly will he MAGA? He doesn't ever say how."

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial. 
American wide summer sales. Free games when you do your taxes. Possibilities are endless. 

Trump/Gaben 2016 
Trump: under my presidency, Ubisoft will never be able to release a bad port again, and when they downgrade the graphics, there will be consequences, BUH-LIEVE ME 
Obama brought back arrested development. If Trump can HL3, I'll MAGA. 
He shouldnt have to say how. He's Donald Trump. Making things great is literaly what he does all day. He cant help but makes things great.
Just winning the presidency and not hating America would be a huge improvement over "I have an interesting voice so no more freedom, **folks**".

When Trump is the Lord Captain Commander, hopefully he'll be able to scrub clean the word folks so that it can be used by normal lads again.
This is the same publication that put articles about Trump under "entertainment" when he first ran for President. Nothing at this point surprises when it comes to the Cuckington Post. 
https://m.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4aawkr/what_is_the_meaning_of_based/?ref=readnext_2
That's a good rule actually. If it wasn't there Trump could be arrested on false charges and be taken out of the running.
..My Trump, Kumbaya...
Does a single picture prove/disprove anything? Wouldn't polls/studies be more important?

Also even if the 'only racist straight sexist white hateful males are for Trump' claim wasn't true I doubt the left would drop it. Too comforting and convenient.

I've seen claims like 'minorities/women for trump have internalized self-hate'. Someone on the left might see that picture and not even recognize that these are thinking humans.
Hoping Trump will be their sugar daddy.  Especially guy in glasses.
Trump does not see race sex gender all that bullshit. He sees potential and how good their work is, and pays accordingly.
Trump should retweet it
If only Trump could be more progressive like the muslims Hillary wants to send in who throw acid in the faces of women who want to pursue education and force rape victims to either marry their assailant or be sentenced to death.
What's funny is that Trump admited that there was unequal pay in his organization, but it favored women, absolutely no media blowback because it hurts Hillarys narrative.
The Hillary sub actually thinks this was a good negative ad that shows how sexist Trump is. 

Hahaha Jesus Christ these people live on a different planet. They don't want equal anything, that want special everything!
Trump has had a very interesting life and done so many things it's pretty amazing how clean it is.
I wouldn't act like they think this is their "end all" piece of evidence. It's been what, a few days since Bezos team was announced? Who knows what else will come out. With that being said, I can't foresee a situation where Trump did anything involving corruption and espionage on a mass scale like you know who.
I don't think that it's so much that he's "clean" I think it's more that all his dirty laundry is out in the open that it's clear no one cares. Like how lyin' Ted was under a microscope for the mistress story? It was big news because it went against his character and was a scandal. Everyone already knows Trump had affairs, so why would you dig that up and attack him with it
Hes has the best affairs. 

>"Trump cheats on super model wife with dozens of other young attractive  super models"

And we're expected to admonish him.
Cheating on your spouse is reprehensible.  It doesn't suddenly become "okay" if the affair is with someone hot.  Monogamy and families are the basic unit of Western civilization.  

The reason not to admonish Trump isn't because he cheated with hot girls, it's because it's old news.  
So this is Amazon CEO Jeff Bozo's attack.

Edit: Here's the context: https://web.archive.org/web/20160512020119/http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/ 

TL;DR New dungeon boss Amazon CEO is trying to Stump the Trump by hiring 20 man dirt army. Owns Washington Post so he also controls the media. 
Being "good" at business is not the end all of business, that sort of thinking creates globalist monopolies...such as Amazon. I wonder why Amazon doesn't want Trump...could it be because they profit massively from bad free trade agreements?
Trump said it himself :ANTITRUST 
That's just business. Trump would do the same. Power moves. 
Ok? Doesn't mean I have to support a globalist corporation who is pushing against Trump.
Trump should point this out.
Would you say he needs to save his...

Trump Card?
In this case that person referred to Trump as a seperate person... but I like your style. 

If this is the best line of attack they can muster, Melania better get somebody to fly down to DC and start measuring drapes. 
##**BTFO**

Lol I just watched this tape. There isn't even proof that it's Trump- it doesn't even sound that much like him. Wtf were they thinking?
Its just bullshit. Liberal media will do this weekly now with any irrelevant bullshit they can find. To force him to have to answer their leading bullshit questions. And help their Marxist globalist queen Hillary. 

But it does not matter. They dont realize. Its a bad strategy. I mean, they have called him Hitler for 8 months. And he keeps moving forward! And he now is tied with her nationally, and has his own race won. While she is getting spanked by Bernie left and right and cant even secure her nomination. 

Nothing can saver her. NOt even media games. And in fact, this makes them look like bullshitters. Since everybody knows all the media is protecting her. 

Trump does not fall, much to their horror. He just keeps moving forward!

#Trump

#Rocky
Foolish Pope thinks that Smite Evil will work on Trump, but Trump's alignment is Chaotic Good. 
My feeling is that it was Trump trying to control the spin on his public persona. It's such a big "who gives a fuck?" kind of thing. He doesn't even saying anything mean about anyone. Does this compare in any way to fucking Hillary threatening Bill's rape victims, or lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation to gain money from foreign leaders? If this is the best Bezos got than Donald may as well start figuring out how he wants to decorate the Oval Office. 
Honestly. Even if this was Trump why the fuck would this be a reason I wouldn't vote for him? Everyone's done dumb shit and this is nothing compared to clintons scandals.
Trump was one of the original Jerky Boys!  We got em!
They're going to be throwing all kinds of shit at Trump's wall to see what sticks

It's just a continuation of the "Trump just disqualified himself" "The end of Trump" media memes... except they are now moving to the offense
It's a rumour that Trump used an alias and was actually his own PR person, a tactic he learned from his father. It's probably true but I don't think it's really that bad.
It just shows how fucking smart he is.

As a nobody, he also fast-talked his way into the top club in Manhattan through sheer force of will. The club president was a drunk which made it much easier, Trump said.

Trump literally bulldozed his way into the elite. They never wanted him. That's why saying he is one of them is functionally retarded.
The best part of that story is that the club owner was concerned Trump would steal all the hot wives of the other rich elite patrons.
Other celebrities use assumed names when they stay at the trump hotels to remain anonymous... Trump is so high energy he uses an assumed name so he can work a second job as his own employee. Fuck yes for America!

Good to know that "John Barron" would have answered the Benghazi phone call rather than crooked Hillary unable to rise from a white wine stupor.
Trump doesn't drink much anymore if any.  Since his brother passed away years ago.

Our Ambassadors and interests around the world can feel safe knowing that Trump will be answering the 3am phone call.  Not Hillary who will be sleeping in with a DO NOT DISTURB policy.
Can't recommend enough.  Picked up the Audio book and listen while in traffic.  Would clear up a lot of the confusion the  few #NeverTrumpers have.  The guy is an absolute madman and the first chapter narrating his phone calls with all types of people, even though he personally doesn't like but must work with to get something done.  

No sadly, Trump should remake that book with him and his kids narrating different chapters themselves.  

*Plane trip + audacity have it done in no time*

https://youtu.be/81yRpZXZdKk?t=2m44s
He doesn't even say anything crazy in it. He could have said he fucked Madonna but he doesn't. It's goofy but it's such a non-issue. Trump fill figure out a way for this not to stick. 
Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump

> http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/#9a6l7wRUBBbSMlEP.99

An audio recording from 25 years ago?  Trump is calling it a scam and what else are we to believe from MSM types who have [edited surveillance tapes](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/index.html) and pushed agendas for the last decade+?
Who saves that from 25 years ago and then be able to dig it up and assume it's Trump.

For all we know that could have been made yesterday by someone in Hillary's camp.
> the washington post

Then you are like who owns that paper?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos

CEO of Amazon. 

[Amazon CEO's newspaper orders 20-man army to dig up dirt on Trump](http://www.wnd.com/2016/05/amazon-ceo-orders-20-man-army-to-dig-up-dirt-on-trump/)
I thought Trump did use an alias and was actually his own PR person. His father also did the same thing from what I've read.
CNN is shilling this hard. Jake Tapper is saying that if Trump is lying about such a small matter, then he must be a huge liar about other, more important thing. 
lmao this is the best they got. An alleged 25 year old tape. Even it is The Donald, NOTHING CAN STUMP THIS MAN.

Those shillary autists are justifying her breaking federal law but this tape is the item that will end Trump.

They are so desperate. I'm glad he dealt with it and was like "Come on guys, can we please get to some more relevant shit - you can't stump the Trump." like a total alpha. Then the reporter falls in line (who is that Matt Bauer? idk I don't watch tv news anymore I just get most of my news from you amazing Pedes.) and starts talking about something more relevant and recent. Bam. I wonder if the media gets tired of being stumped all the time?
**Reporter:** "Oh hai, Mr. Trump, someone claims they went through your trash 20 years ago and they found a dirty napkin with the words 'I am a thief' written in what looks like your handwriting, can you please comment on this?"
**Trump:** "I know you're pandering to your cuck audience, but can we talk about grown up stuff?"

SAVAGE!
LOL. The traitors are getting so desperate. Poor Jeff Bozo of Amazon hates Trump. 

Has like **20** of his "journalist" whose only job now is to bullshit about Trump as much as they can. Since that paper also loves Obama, and Hillary. At least 20 is what was reported. They probably got more, all working in some dungeon 24/7, and muttering "we must get Trump, we must get Trump". "we are with her, we are with her, Hillary"

To force him to have to answer bullshit like this when he goes on these liberal shows with these "journalist". 

It will not stop him. When will you learn media. NOBODY likes you that much anymore. Both sides think you are garbage now. NObody really trust you that much. Most just see you as a Soap Opera of bullshit. 

#WashingtonPost

LMAO. I laugh at thee. 

Even toilet paper is more relevant, and useful than much of our media and what is considered "journalism" now. 

The more you attack him, the more people get fed up with so much of your bullshit.  

Of course, **#CrookedHillary** is just facing a casual "security inquiry" liberal media. Just like getting an anti virus check. Thats what the FBI is doing. Protect her all you can Media. People still hate her. And Trump will easily Schlong her.  
it's the same as the Bill DiBlasio ad that I've heard on radio in recent months that apparently tries to criticize Trump using an "audio recording of his own voice" but when you listen it sounds like someone already doing a bad voice impersonation and the pitch is too high. Liberals have no shame, and they will pull any trick to make you believe the other side is bad.
[Here's the full story with the full 15 minute video.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)

Frankly if this the best attack they have, they're going to lose. Trump making sure he gets the correct spin on his public persona doesn't really compare to Hillary lying about Benghazi, or using the Clinton Foundation as a way to launder money, or threatening Bill's rape victims.
WTF man. Between this and that other interviewer who wouldn't drop the tax return bull shit. 

I can't wait until Trump is the next President and make them all look like complete idiots. 
Listened to the tape. Didn't hear anything particularly damning, but it does sound like Trump. Not so much in tone but how he speaks.
Honestly, this is almost definitely Trump. The accent is good, but it's unmistakably Trump's cadence, and Trumps NYC accent creeps in from time to time. I don't know why Trump's denying it - it's actually kind of funny.

The good news, though, is that this is apparently the worst dirt the media has been able to dig up on Trump. Sad!
He probably was mean to someone in one of these calls and figures it's best to deny the whole thing.

Let's compare: Trump probably lying about posing as his own publicist 25 years ago vs. Hillary trying to throw a filmmaker under the bus and blame him for violence/killings while lying to Benghazi victims' families.
LOL!

So this 25 year old prank call recording is the best they have to trash Trump with? Give me a break.
#**Lmao i dont doubt for a second it wasn't Donald Trump but this just makes me love him even more MAGA**
It's a totally hilarious radio interview of Trump pretending to be Trump's spokesman, explaining his then-current situation with women, real estate and maybe more I didn't hear.

This is definitely a guy that would be fun to have a beer with.

If the press can't get a legit smile out of it, they have no sense of humor.
WaPo Bezos vanity project, nobody can read it without retching. Story about phony call means nothing but intent is to trash Trump that he called under presumed name, no evidence. Worse than Tabloid which has true stories about Ted. Idiotic, phony hoax. Happens all the time to stupid news people. They just want to smear Trump with their boy reporter suspicions which are meaningless. He was a private person. What about the 20 years Obama spent with Rev Right and G-d America? Investigating Obama should be interesting such as his birth certificate. Where were they during Bengazi, those two incompetents, Hillary and Obama? Investigating Hillary should yield gold for the WaPo. Investigating Bill-ary and how she Enables the Energizer Bunny for Bill, who gives this rich divorcee bombshell Foundation money, that's juicy and it is relevant. Because like all the things Hillary does, it is ILLEGAL and provable.
As a New Yorker, the voices are clearly different.

If you can't tell, this is what Trump sounded like in 1991: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rksd80-FCAw

I'll concede the phrasing sounds like Trump, but it's either not him or he heavily toned down his intonation and speaking mannerisms. I've also heard Trump talk with a lower key on CNN over the phone and it still doesn't sound like the guy in the video.

Here's a more recent phone interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMwzElHMcHU

Of course, I could be wrong, because some excepts sound more like him than others, but if it was him, he was definitely masking it.
Trumps voice from 25 years ago was much higher pitched than it is now. I listened but I just don't think it was him. They probably heard that he did that and decided to try one out with an impersonator to see if they could pull it off. Anyway, it is so petty compared to all the email and other scandals.  
A kid on Watters World from Queens sounded just like Trump. This is 2016 and kids are born sounding like Trump. Should be a contest. Actually dishonest WaPo is asking for it. They will have thousands of John Millers pretending to be Trump pulling their legs.

Hillary just sounds more and more ridiculous every time she speaks. Her holier-than-thou attitude is disgusting. She even thinks she can twist an FBI investigation to sound like it's nothing, makes up her own terms even, 'security inquiry' HA! I hope that pissed off the FBI and they investigate her even harder. All her flunkies sound dumb and keep getting BTFO. Im looking forward to when Trump becomes president and we put this mess of an election behind us and Shillary behind bars. 
Trump is the Shakespeare of twitter, every 140 character reply is an instant classic. 
Yes Jeb, Trump is going to insult the criminal establishment of the way to the Whitehouse. 
The Onion was bought out by major Hillary investors. They probably think this is an attack and will hurt Trump.
Then I hope they attack every day! Attack often! Got nothing to see now that Trump ain't holding as many rallies as he used to - or at all.
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Doesn't need to say anything, the hard core believers take anything said about trump negatively.

Trump pets a puppy

Oh no trump hates kittens
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
I loved that fued back in the day, I always hated rosie o'donnell and that was what, 10 years ago?  Trump dominated that one too.
Her daughter said that she is a fake, a slob, neglectful parent. And also that she abandoned her and did not help her during a drug  problem. But Rosie thought Trump was evil for giving Miss America another chance with her drug problem.

And Rosie calls Trump the evil one almost weekly. Of course, it is Trump that has 5 loving, loyal, humble, kind, not druggies,  well adjusted, and the older ones completely successful children. 

I have not heard about the alocoholism. But if i remember her daughter did say  Rosie drinks a lot of beer daily. 
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
Every single ad I've seen Hillary put out vs. Trump is an emotional appeal, totally devoid of either criticism of his policies or touting her own plans.  It all boils down to "WAAAAAAA!"
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
I really don't think that is her point. Her point is that Trump thinks 'equal work = equal pay'. However the whole feministic, unequal pay problem is premised on the notion that a bunch of structural factors - outside of simply individual hard work - stop equal pay from being realized. These are things like the fact that women still stay home more than men and thus lose career chances, some fields have a boys club mentality making promotion less likely, women are looked down on and not given the same tasks to show improvement, and so on.

I am not saying I agree with the feminist position, but I am 99% that is the point H is trying to make :)
Let me see if I understand your theory: Essentially, Trump is clueless  because he is ignoring all of the injustice created in the real world by man's dominance in the workplace.   Very much similar to the hidden white privilege one experiences by being white. 
  
  

And I think the corollary to that is:

She's trying to say Trump is wrong about that supposed sentiment, and pay is still somehow disparate between men and women, and therefore affirmative steps need to be taken which favor women because despite equivalent competency women still can't break this fictitious ceiling that some people perceive.

Of course that is all pandering BS and she probably is entirely incapable of intelligently deciphering the real economic labor factors in play.
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Shit's like dissing Dre. You try to stump Trump you just stump yo'self.
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
MSM will try to make the General sound like a tight race.  But we want a blowout because landslide numbers for Trump = stronger mandate!
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
Trump should retweet it.
Donald Trump believes in equal rights for women and Hillary thinks that women should have more equality than that.
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
But...seriously.  Trump basically said 'Equal Pay for Equal Work' and they try to say 'look, look!  What a bad guy!'
HAHA!

Equal pay for equal work.

Thanks Hillary for converting more Trump supporters!
Hills on the Trump Train now!
The debate writes itself!

Hillary: And Donald Trump's sexist remarks cannot stand! He says women will make the same pay if they do the same job!

Everybody: ....and?

And jesus, that tweet:

-Trump says women will get equal pay for equal work

-Trump cherishes women

-Time to believe what Trump says

Savage?
The DNC may just go with Bernie seeing how Trump is already dominating Clinton. 
I think she's _trying_ to say that Trump is saying that women currently make less because they don't do as good of a job, which is an offensive statement to women to claim they are not currently as hard of workers as men. But I'm honestly not 100% that that is how she is trying to spin it.
lol, that line was used on the wild shill that appeared in Can't stump the Trump 4.


Well, the implication of what Trump said is that women in general *aren't* doing as good a job as men (as evidenced by the fact they are paid less). And that's kind of an offensive thing to say.
Isn't the implication that since women make 75 cents on the dollar that every man makes for the same job at the same level, that Trump is saying women are paid that amount because they currently AREN'T doing as good of a job as their male coworkers?
(Edit: wooorrrdsss)
It was probably done by their professional chef to make sure it looks perfect. Under Trump we should train all cooks to be chefs. 

**Make Our Food Great Again**
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thank you. You'd be doing us and yourself a favor by sharing my story with your friends who may be against the idea of Trump. This sentence sums it up: Either you're for Trump, or you hate America.
We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
Thank you so much, I (we) really appreciate that. I hope you share my story with your friends, especially if they're against Trump. That man is a blessing from the heavens. Without him we'd be stuck with establishment assholes who only want to Globalize the world into misery. 
Asylum because religious persecution by muslims in Bosnia. We're catholic. As soon as these snakes have the majority, it's game over.

Three big reasons why I'm voting for Trump:

* Illegal immigration needs to stop

* Muslims should not be taken in by the thousands (they're not our friends, believe me)

* Gun rights

This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.
[watch the short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Y7cA8w6Hk)

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
> Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

What program?

>He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.

The war on drugs? Heavy prison sentences?
> Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs. 
Mccain got 3, Romney gets 7, Trump gets 13.

#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.

I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
 Even with like 20 percent and the increased white vote Trump can win easily.  I predict he will get about 15-20 percent of the black vote as well
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
The problem is the media, activists and the politicians have fooled themselves into believing Hispanics are one homogeneous group or race of people that can be controlled politically.That ignorance will cost the Dems votes and Trump will do better than everyone is expecting with Hispanic voters.
I am confused and could have sworn he wouldn't win this demographic. Can someone explain to me why Hispanic voters are backing Trump?
Because polls consistently show Trump has Hispanic disapproval at around 80%. I love the man but there's no way this poll is accurate.

Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.
Anyone have a for/against(empty threat to leave the country) Trump list of celebrities?

MAGA - Trump 2016


He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
Problem is the journalist doesn't realize Trump is the God Emperor. When he prays to God, Trump hears it.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4j5xrh/donald_trump_denies_washington_post_audio_full/
They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

Or show you this:

**Our media are our enemy now. Most of it is garbage. And most of them are liberal marxist globalist snake pieces of shit. Not journalist anymore. But professional race baiters, bullshitters, and manipulators.** 
Before the end of my life I must make a pilgrimage to Trump Tower and partake in the World's Greatest Taco Bowls.

#TRUMP TACO BOWL > JEB! GUAC BOWLE
Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.  

**Trump steel won't bend or break.**
#MAGA
Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.
Pretty sure this is gonna end up on a Can't Stump The Trump video
Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
How embarrassing. You can hear the desperation in his voice trying to nail Trump on his tax returns and then actually trying to defend Hillary for her missing emails.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
I was a trump supporter (small t) prior to this morning, but what the hell just happened on GMA this morning made me a Mega TRUMP supporter.  Finally a man that has something hanging between his legs and can tell it how it is, not that he has not been doing this all along, but hey, way to shut up snuffaluffagas.  You have my vote Mr Trump.
His ability to get up and just say wtf we are all thinking is my favorite part about him. 

Reporter: Your tax returns may show that you pay a low tax rate 

Trump: I fight very hard to pay as little in taxes as possible and I've openly been saying that for 2 years, they waste our money and throw it down the drain. 


Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
I can't believe Stepnfetchitopolous tried to Stump The Trump. 
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Trump is fearless.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
Even if Trump is in the clear with the tax issues, and he is actually waiting for the audit to end, this makes him look bad. It is one of the few things that Hillary has got against him, even though it is nothing serious. The fact that they keep saying he hasn't released them is not a good viewpoint for Trump. Never will the media call Hillary out for her crimes, her crimes in Benghazi, her threats and maybe even murders of past people in the "clinton circle", or the threats to bill's former women, but they will never speak a word. But for Trump, they will make him seem like a criminal for not releasing his tax info yet.

It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.
Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
Actually, according to [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/university/donald-trump-biography/donald-trump-net-worth.asp), Trump inherited about 75 million dollars from his dad in 1999:

>In 1999, when patriarch Fred Trump died, his estate of between $250 – $300 million was divided equally among his four surviving children.

So, if Trump had invested that in a really really really good investment low risk portfolio with a return of 10% annually, he would have:

75

82.5

90.75

99.825

109.8075

120.78825

132.867075

146.1537825

160.7691608

176.8460768

194.5306845

213.983753

235.3821283

258.9203411

284.8123752

313.2936127

344.622974

379.0852714 million dollars

Instead of the 4.5 billion estimated by Forbes. So, that about him getting more money from a savings account is false. I mean, he started in a fairly well privileged position, but let’s keep the facts right (not pun intended).
The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
Guys, it's **CURRENT YEAR**.

Trump? Really?
what you call management I call omniscience. If you knew exactly when to sell and exactly when to buy then I agree you could get more than 7% growth by transferring wealth from others to yourself. Donald Trump got ~30% growth by creating wealth.
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
According to who? or what criteria? 

Trump's doing pretty well, wouldn't you say? Would you agree he's at least doing *okay* as far as his financial situation goes?
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING.

Hey don't bring Canada into this... Most Canadians don't agree with what Trump stands for.. Watching your political process is like watch a reality TV show. We are very happy with our new and gracious overlord Justin Trudeau.
This is the same publication that put articles about Trump under "entertainment" when he first ran for President. Nothing at this point surprises when it comes to the Cuckington Post. 
For a blue state, I've gotten a lot of supportive comments when I wear my Trump hoodie around in NY. Always in the doctor's office though I get a bunch of thumbs up and things, loooot of doctors seem to love him.
The opposition has used fear and shaming to play against the psyche of the population. That's why you saw Trump winning almost anywhere there was a real election while the caucuses lent more towards Cruz or another candidate, being more socially accepted to voice in front of your neighbors. 
I'm going to see Rob Zombie this Sunday, and I'm going to be wearing my Trump shirt and MAGA hat.
Fuck the Berniebots that have an issue. I try to wear my Cameron Lee High Energy hat with a Trump shirt (I have every color) all weekend in public in NY. I do get sketched out about restaurants though, I fear fluid contamination.
That's a great shirt, I was looking km Trump's website and I couldn't find that particular shirt. Could you link me to where you found it??
That Orlando and Central Florida area will be critical for Trump. It's been traditionally red with the space program and all their D.o.D. contracting. That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
Serious question:

I'm a patriot living abroad as a digital nomad. I want some Trump merch because it's awesome and would make some of these euro's salty as fuck, but Trump doesn't ship over seas.

What do I need to do to get some God Emperor material?
If you want the official Donald J Trump made in America shirts off his website, I'm sure one of us centipedes could receive it and send it to you. 
Aliexpress sell Trump stuff.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
Assuming it's Disneyland, then you're actually really brave. Hell as someone who lives in OC I'd never get a Trump bumper sticker on my car because the odds of me going to cities like Santa Ana and having it unscathed or even me not getting harassed are low.
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.

Holy fucking shit I could get hundreds more people to vote for him if he did this.

Trump = Big Boss?

Also, Huey sounds eerily similar to Hillary. Just saying.
President Trump and Kojima will show konami "big league", generating the highest sales ever seen!
>"How exactly will he MAGA? He doesn't ever say how."

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial. 
American wide summer sales. Free games when you do your taxes. Possibilities are endless. 

Trump/Gaben 2016 
Trump: under my presidency, Ubisoft will never be able to release a bad port again, and when they downgrade the graphics, there will be consequences, BUH-LIEVE ME 
Obama brought back arrested development. If Trump can HL3, I'll MAGA. 
He shouldnt have to say how. He's Donald Trump. Making things great is literaly what he does all day. He cant help but makes things great.
Just winning the presidency and not hating America would be a huge improvement over "I have an interesting voice so no more freedom, **folks**".

When Trump is the Lord Captain Commander, hopefully he'll be able to scrub clean the word folks so that it can be used by normal lads again.
tired of this cuck trying to bandwagon off of the glorious leader Trump
ah yeah,,,that exactly the point to reach a bigger audience and start uncucking people and simply not engagins is starting to not work just like demonizing people isnt, perfect example 

#Lord God Emperor Trump 
Trump does not see race sex gender all that bullshit. He sees potential and how good their work is, and pays accordingly.
Trump should retweet it
If only Trump could be more progressive like the muslims Hillary wants to send in who throw acid in the faces of women who want to pursue education and force rape victims to either marry their assailant or be sentenced to death.
What's funny is that Trump admited that there was unequal pay in his organization, but it favored women, absolutely no media blowback because it hurts Hillarys narrative.
The Hillary sub actually thinks this was a good negative ad that shows how sexist Trump is. 

Hahaha Jesus Christ these people live on a different planet. They don't want equal anything, that want special everything!
It's crazy what a landslide this is going to be.

Honestly, back at the end of last year, I was sceptical. She's Hillary Clinton after all. Basically entitled to the nomination, and pretty much the highest profile person running. But it's staggering how badly she is doing, and how Trump is pushing her buttons so well.
That's a good rule actually. If it wasn't there Trump could be arrested on false charges and be taken out of the running.
..My Trump, Kumbaya...
Does a single picture prove/disprove anything? Wouldn't polls/studies be more important?

Also even if the 'only racist straight sexist white hateful males are for Trump' claim wasn't true I doubt the left would drop it. Too comforting and convenient.

I've seen claims like 'minorities/women for trump have internalized self-hate'. Someone on the left might see that picture and not even recognize that these are thinking humans.
Hoping Trump will be their sugar daddy.  Especially guy in glasses.
Warren just does not grasp tactics. She falls into every one of Trumps traps and looks like a fool.
Going after Goofy Liz before she actually got the nomination was a masterstroke (as if we can expect anything less from the God Emperor!) for the following reasons:

1- If Crooked Hillary/Bernout **don't** pick her up after her name has been thrown around in the media, it will appear as though Trump ruined her enough to make her unviable and scared them away from their first choice.

2 - If they DO pick up Goofy Liz as VP, it makes it look like Trump predicted it and forced their choice for them. They are no longer making a choice for VP, they're making a choice to defy Donald Trump.

3 - The more she fights back before even getting the nomination, the more he can point at her and say "LOOK! She doesn't even work at her job *now*!" She either retaliates and appears to be another disgusting, lazy politician (true) or she just takes it and appears weak and afraid of Trump (also true).

#MASTER CLASS
Trump is playing professional Starcraft 2 while they are playing checkers.
This is why Trump preemptively went after Warren. He knows they're vetting her, and she'll go in wounded by Trump right out the gate.
Be careful. Trump's victory **DEPENDS** on having a strong base of independent and, yes, even ex-Bernie voters. Elizabeth Warren is very popular among both of those groups.

Do not underestimate her, Warren is an excellent pick, tactically.

She has the one scandal about her "Native-Americaness" but the Clinton campaign is no stranger to scandal; and neither is Trump.
I think it also has something to do with Robin Williams holding a special place in my heart and that song being one of my favorite Disney songs if not my absolute favorite. I like to think if he was still around he would do great imitations of Trump and $hillary.

Besides all that, the song is a great choice for this parody since in the original lyrics there's literally a line that says, "Brush up your Sunday salaam."

Why is Crooked Hillary never on Fox News to take tough questions? Trump is on every network, almost every day, even when he knows he will get tough questions. 
Trump said that he hopes she stays spokeswoman because the more she talks the more votes he gets.
Hillary just sounds more and more ridiculous every time she speaks. Her holier-than-thou attitude is disgusting. She even thinks she can twist an FBI investigation to sound like it's nothing, makes up her own terms even, 'security inquiry' HA! I hope that pissed off the FBI and they investigate her even harder. All her flunkies sound dumb and keep getting BTFO. Im looking forward to when Trump becomes president and we put this mess of an election behind us and Shillary behind bars.

Trump is the Shakespeare of twitter, every 140 character reply is an instant classic. 
The Onion was bought out by major Hillary investors. They probably think this is an attack and will hurt Trump.
Then I hope they attack every day! Attack often! Got nothing to see now that Trump ain't holding as many rallies as he used to - or at all.
Yes Jeb, Trump is going to insult the criminal establishment of the way to the Whitehouse.

That because women currently get paid less = Donald Trump (through the eyes of those with a skewed interpretation of the wage gap) thinks women are inferior.


You really have to be on a fucked up wavelength to even comprehend how the thought process for anything with these people goes.
She's pointing this quote out as absurd which it is under liberal logic. To them women already work as hard as men and still make less so for Trump to say that would appear ignorant in their minds. It doesn't make sense to anyone whose not already committed to the liberal agenda. 
To understand it you first have to understand that Team Hillary actually fell for their own bullshit and really do believe in the wage gap myth. Going from there it's clear she is trying to insinuate that Trump thinks women should continue to make the same as they do now (less than men) if they do the same work. 

Now obviously since regular people don't live in the same bubble as Hillary and aren't surrounded by yes men, they're probably not going to go through all of her mental gymnastics to reach that conclusion and this will back fire on her.

In other words: Hillary needs to get out more.
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
Every single ad I've seen Hillary put out vs. Trump is an emotional appeal, totally devoid of either criticism of his policies or touting her own plans.  It all boils down to "WAAAAAAA!"
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
It's the best response Trump could've given. It lets him deflect any questions about pay inequality (a myth, but political suicide to acknowledge). He's not responsible for the "wage gap" but he implies that if there are companies who are doing this he may be willing to stand up for women

It's the worst response she could've given since it plays the woman card, again, and indicates to many that she doesn't believe women should be paid the same for doing the same job. Good thing her very own foundation proves this for us
I really don't think that is her point. Her point is that Trump thinks 'equal work = equal pay'. However the whole feministic, unequal pay problem is premised on the notion that a bunch of structural factors - outside of simply individual hard work - stop equal pay from being realized. These are things like the fact that women still stay home more than men and thus lose career chances, some fields have a boys club mentality making promotion less likely, women are looked down on and not given the same tasks to show improvement, and so on.

I am not saying I agree with the feminist position, but I am 99% that is the point H is trying to make :)
Let me see if I understand your theory: Essentially, Trump is clueless  because he is ignoring all of the injustice created in the real world by man's dominance in the workplace.   Very much similar to the hidden white privilege one experiences by being white. 
  
  

And I think the corollary to that is:

She's trying to say Trump is wrong about that supposed sentiment, and pay is still somehow disparate between men and women, and therefore affirmative steps need to be taken which favor women because despite equivalent competency women still can't break this fictitious ceiling that some people perceive.

Of course that is all pandering BS and she probably is entirely incapable of intelligently deciphering the real economic labor factors in play.
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Doesn't need to say anything, the hard core believers take anything said about trump negatively.

Trump pets a puppy

Oh no trump hates kittens
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
I loved that fued back in the day, I always hated rosie o'donnell and that was what, 10 years ago?  Trump dominated that one too.
Her daughter said that she is a fake, a slob, neglectful parent. And also that she abandoned her and did not help her during a drug  problem. But Rosie thought Trump was evil for giving Miss America another chance with her drug problem.

And Rosie calls Trump the evil one almost weekly. Of course, it is Trump that has 5 loving, loyal, humble, kind, not druggies,  well adjusted, and the older ones completely successful children. 

I have not heard about the alocoholism. But if i remember her daughter did say  Rosie drinks a lot of beer daily. 
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Shit's like dissing Dre. You try to stump Trump you just stump yo'self.
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
Every day that Trump hammers Crooked Hillary makes it more likely the Democratic superdelegates are going to get nervous and flip to Bernie. 

I've said it before and I'll say it again:  Bernie Sanders has a better chance to beat Trump than Crooked Hillary. His supporters are far more enthusiastic and Clinton's are much more likely to vote for Bernie than flip and vote for Trump. 
MSM will try to make the General sound like a tight race.  But we want a blowout because landslide numbers for Trump = stronger mandate!
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
Trump should retweet it.
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
Donald Trump believes in equal rights for women and Hillary thinks that women should have more equality than that.
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
But...seriously.  Trump basically said 'Equal Pay for Equal Work' and they try to say 'look, look!  What a bad guy!'
HAHA!

Equal pay for equal work.

Thanks Hillary for converting more Trump supporters!
Hills on the Trump Train now!
The debate writes itself!

Hillary: And Donald Trump's sexist remarks cannot stand! He says women will make the same pay if they do the same job!

Everybody: ....and?

And jesus, that tweet:

-Trump says women will get equal pay for equal work

-Trump cherishes women

-Time to believe what Trump says

Savage?
The DNC may just go with Bernie seeing how Trump is already dominating Clinton. 
I think she's _trying_ to say that Trump is saying that women currently make less because they don't do as good of a job, which is an offensive statement to women to claim they are not currently as hard of workers as men. But I'm honestly not 100% that that is how she is trying to spin it.
lol, that line was used on the wild shill that appeared in Can't stump the Trump 4.


"Donald Trump says he cherishes' women"

"we should start believing Trump's rethoric"

Jesus christ this woman is incompetent. Not because she is female though don't get triggered
If anything, this only shows me that Trump sees women as equals to men.
Every time Hillary opens her mouth, another person votes for Trump. 
They've been so brainwashed by their own rhetoric to think that Trump's a misogynist that literally anything he says related to women is automatically assumed to be an insult.

"I love all women"

BREAKING: Trump wants to sexually assault all women!
Well, the implication of what Trump said is that women in general *aren't* doing as good a job as men (as evidenced by the fact they are paid less). And that's kind of an offensive thing to say.
Isn't the implication that since women make 75 cents on the dollar that every man makes for the same job at the same level, that Trump is saying women are paid that amount because they currently AREN'T doing as good of a job as their male coworkers?
(Edit: wooorrrdsss)
It was probably done by their professional chef to make sure it looks perfect. Under Trump we should train all cooks to be chefs. 

**Make Our Food Great Again**
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thank you. You'd be doing us and yourself a favor by sharing my story with your friends who may be against the idea of Trump. This sentence sums it up: Either you're for Trump, or you hate America.
We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
Thank you so much, I (we) really appreciate that. I hope you share my story with your friends, especially if they're against Trump. That man is a blessing from the heavens. Without him we'd be stuck with establishment assholes who only want to Globalize the world into misery. 
Asylum because religious persecution by muslims in Bosnia. We're catholic. As soon as these snakes have the majority, it's game over.

Three big reasons why I'm voting for Trump:

* Illegal immigration needs to stop

* Muslims should not be taken in by the thousands (they're not our friends, believe me)

* Gun rights

This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.
[watch the short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Y7cA8w6Hk)

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs. 
Mccain got 3, Romney gets 7, Trump gets 13. 
That will help Trump's push into the rust belt and northeast. Romney list every damn state North and East of Kentucky
#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.

I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
 Even with like 20 percent and the increased white vote Trump can win easily.  I predict he will get about 15-20 percent of the black vote as well
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
The problem is the media, activists and the politicians have fooled themselves into believing Hispanics are one homogeneous group or race of people that can be controlled politically.That ignorance will cost the Dems votes and Trump will do better than everyone is expecting with Hispanic voters.
I am confused and could have sworn he wouldn't win this demographic. Can someone explain to me why Hispanic voters are backing Trump?
Because polls consistently show Trump has Hispanic disapproval at around 80%. I love the man but there's no way this poll is accurate.

I actually voted for Donald Trump in the March Primary. At this time in high school the majority of students are 18.

Rambo would definitely be a Trump supporter because Trump supports the vets. 
Don't forget Marion Cobretti, Judge Dread, and Tango... or Cash... I can never remember who was who in that one. I just hope Kurt Russell is for Trump too so it won't matter. 
Trump will enforce the *luaaaaaaw*
Crime is the disease. Trump is the cure.
Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character. One of them takes a nuanced approach and pokes fun at himself during it, while the other gets on a soapbox about refugees. I guarantee none of those refugees will be anywhere near his mountainside mansion in Italy.

"We will not be governed by fear" said the nervous man failing to form coherent sentences while he attempts to create mass hysteria over patriotism.
As they do nothing but try to make people fearful of a Trump presidency.  They are everything that they rail against.  
For having made a career glorifying gun violence, Stallone is *massively* anti-gun. He has, publicly, advocated for door-to-door confiscation of all guns. Great that he's pro-Trump, but I have a hard time applying positive terms to the guy.
Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.
Anyone have a for/against(empty threat to leave the country) Trump list of celebrities?

Full quote from [Variety](http://variety.com/2016/film/news/sylvester-stallone-donald-trump-1201675595/)

“I love Donald Trump, he’s a great [Dickensian]( https://www.google.com/search?q=Dickinsian&oq=Dickinsian&aqs=chrome..69i57.13981j0j4&client=ms-android-att-us&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dickensian+meaning) character. You know what I mean? There are certain people like Arnold, Babe Ruth, that are bigger than life. But I don’t know how that translates to running the world.(laughing)”
I think it's more about those who just claim to be trans to get special privilege. Like that werecamel that spit on the Trump supporter then immediately said "don't hit me I'm trans"

He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
Problem is the journalist doesn't realize Trump is the God Emperor. When he prays to God, Trump hears it.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.

They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.  

**Trump steel won't bend or break.**
#MAGA
Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.
Pretty sure this is gonna end up on a Can't Stump The Trump video
Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
How embarrassing. You can hear the desperation in his voice trying to nail Trump on his tax returns and then actually trying to defend Hillary for her missing emails.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
I was a trump supporter (small t) prior to this morning, but what the hell just happened on GMA this morning made me a Mega TRUMP supporter.  Finally a man that has something hanging between his legs and can tell it how it is, not that he has not been doing this all along, but hey, way to shut up snuffaluffagas.  You have my vote Mr Trump.
His ability to get up and just say wtf we are all thinking is my favorite part about him. 

Reporter: Your tax returns may show that you pay a low tax rate 

Trump: I fight very hard to pay as little in taxes as possible and I've openly been saying that for 2 years, they waste our money and throw it down the drain. 


Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
I can't believe Stepnfetchitopolous tried to Stump The Trump. 
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Trump is fearless.
Why won't Donald Trump release his tax returns if they're as boring as he says they are?
Ps. Being under audit is irrelevant.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
Even if Trump is in the clear with the tax issues, and he is actually waiting for the audit to end, this makes him look bad. It is one of the few things that Hillary has got against him, even though it is nothing serious. The fact that they keep saying he hasn't released them is not a good viewpoint for Trump. Never will the media call Hillary out for her crimes, her crimes in Benghazi, her threats and maybe even murders of past people in the "clinton circle", or the threats to bill's former women, but they will never speak a word. But for Trump, they will make him seem like a criminal for not releasing his tax info yet.

It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.
Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
Actually, according to [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/university/donald-trump-biography/donald-trump-net-worth.asp), Trump inherited about 75 million dollars from his dad in 1999:

>In 1999, when patriarch Fred Trump died, his estate of between $250 – $300 million was divided equally among his four surviving children.

So, if Trump had invested that in a really really really good investment low risk portfolio with a return of 10% annually, he would have:

75

82.5

90.75

99.825

109.8075

120.78825

132.867075

146.1537825

160.7691608

176.8460768

194.5306845

213.983753

235.3821283

258.9203411

284.8123752

313.2936127

344.622974

379.0852714 million dollars

Instead of the 4.5 billion estimated by Forbes. So, that about him getting more money from a savings account is false. I mean, he started in a fairly well privileged position, but let’s keep the facts right (not pun intended).
The women's studies factories are only hiring illegal immigrants.   That's why I support Trump.


The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
Guys, it's **CURRENT YEAR**.

Trump? Really?
what you call management I call omniscience. If you knew exactly when to sell and exactly when to buy then I agree you could get more than 7% growth by transferring wealth from others to yourself. Donald Trump got ~30% growth by creating wealth.
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
According to who? or what criteria? 

Trump's doing pretty well, wouldn't you say? Would you agree he's at least doing *okay* as far as his financial situation goes?
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING.

This is the same publication that put articles about Trump under "entertainment" when he first ran for President. Nothing at this point surprises when it comes to the Cuckington Post. 
Warren just does not grasp tactics. She falls into every one of Trumps traps and looks like a fool.
Going after Goofy Liz before she actually got the nomination was a masterstroke (as if we can expect anything less from the God Emperor!) for the following reasons:

1- If Crooked Hillary/Bernout **don't** pick her up after her name has been thrown around in the media, it will appear as though Trump ruined her enough to make her unviable and scared them away from their first choice.

2 - If they DO pick up Goofy Liz as VP, it makes it look like Trump predicted it and forced their choice for them. They are no longer making a choice for VP, they're making a choice to defy Donald Trump.

3 - The more she fights back before even getting the nomination, the more he can point at her and say "LOOK! She doesn't even work at her job *now*!" She either retaliates and appears to be another disgusting, lazy politician (true) or she just takes it and appears weak and afraid of Trump (also true).

#MASTER CLASS
Trump is playing professional Starcraft 2 while they are playing checkers.
This is why Trump preemptively went after Warren. He knows they're vetting her, and she'll go in wounded by Trump right out the gate.
Be careful. Trump's victory **DEPENDS** on having a strong base of independent and, yes, even ex-Bernie voters. Elizabeth Warren is very popular among both of those groups.

Do not underestimate her, Warren is an excellent pick, tactically.

She has the one scandal about her "Native-Americaness" but the Clinton campaign is no stranger to scandal; and neither is Trump.
Why is she being considered?  If her twitter attacks on Trump were the test she clearly failed.

For a blue state, I've gotten a lot of supportive comments when I wear my Trump hoodie around in NY. Always in the doctor's office though I get a bunch of thumbs up and things, loooot of doctors seem to love him.
The opposition has used fear and shaming to play against the psyche of the population. That's why you saw Trump winning almost anywhere there was a real election while the caucuses lent more towards Cruz or another candidate, being more socially accepted to voice in front of your neighbors. 
I'm going to see Rob Zombie this Sunday, and I'm going to be wearing my Trump shirt and MAGA hat.
Fuck the Berniebots that have an issue. I try to wear my Cameron Lee High Energy hat with a Trump shirt (I have every color) all weekend in public in NY. I do get sketched out about restaurants though, I fear fluid contamination.
That's a great shirt, I was looking km Trump's website and I couldn't find that particular shirt. Could you link me to where you found it??
That Orlando and Central Florida area will be critical for Trump. It's been traditionally red with the space program and all their D.o.D. contracting. That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
Serious question:

I'm a patriot living abroad as a digital nomad. I want some Trump merch because it's awesome and would make some of these euro's salty as fuck, but Trump doesn't ship over seas.

What do I need to do to get some God Emperor material?
If you want the official Donald J Trump made in America shirts off his website, I'm sure one of us centipedes could receive it and send it to you. 
Aliexpress sell Trump stuff.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
Assuming it's Disneyland, then you're actually really brave. Hell as someone who lives in OC I'd never get a Trump bumper sticker on my car because the odds of me going to cities like Santa Ana and having it unscathed or even me not getting harassed are low.
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.
Trump does not see race sex gender all that bullshit. He sees potential and how good their work is, and pays accordingly.
Trump should retweet it
If only Trump could be more progressive like the muslims Hillary wants to send in who throw acid in the faces of women who want to pursue education and force rape victims to either marry their assailant or be sentenced to death.
What's funny is that Trump admited that there was unequal pay in his organization, but it favored women, absolutely no media blowback because it hurts Hillarys narrative.
The Hillary sub actually thinks this was a good negative ad that shows how sexist Trump is. 

Hahaha Jesus Christ these people live on a different planet. They don't want equal anything, that want special everything!
It's crazy what a landslide this is going to be.

Honestly, back at the end of last year, I was sceptical. She's Hillary Clinton after all. Basically entitled to the nomination, and pretty much the highest profile person running. But it's staggering how badly she is doing, and how Trump is pushing her buttons so well.
Holy fucking shit I could get hundreds more people to vote for him if he did this.

Trump = Big Boss?

Also, Huey sounds eerily similar to Hillary. Just saying.
President Trump and Kojima will show konami "big league", generating the highest sales ever seen!
>"How exactly will he MAGA? He doesn't ever say how."

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
Trump: under my presidency, Ubisoft will never be able to release a bad port again, and when they downgrade the graphics, there will be consequences, BUH-LIEVE ME 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial. 
American wide summer sales. Free games when you do your taxes. Possibilities are endless. 

Trump/Gaben 2016 
Obama brought back arrested development. If Trump can HL3, I'll MAGA. 
He shouldnt have to say how. He's Donald Trump. Making things great is literaly what he does all day. He cant help but makes things great.
Just winning the presidency and not hating America would be a huge improvement over "I have an interesting voice so no more freedom, **folks**".

When Trump is the Lord Captain Commander, hopefully he'll be able to scrub clean the word folks so that it can be used by normal lads again.
tired of this cuck trying to bandwagon off of the glorious leader Trump
ah yeah,,,that exactly the point to reach a bigger audience and start uncucking people and simply not engagins is starting to not work just like demonizing people isnt, perfect example 

#Lord God Emperor Trump 
That's a good rule actually. If it wasn't there Trump could be arrested on false charges and be taken out of the running.
..My Trump, Kumbaya...
Does a single picture prove/disprove anything? Wouldn't polls/studies be more important?

Also even if the 'only racist straight sexist white hateful males are for Trump' claim wasn't true I doubt the left would drop it. Too comforting and convenient.

I've seen claims like 'minorities/women for trump have internalized self-hate'. Someone on the left might see that picture and not even recognize that these are thinking humans.
Hoping Trump will be their sugar daddy.  Especially guy in glasses.
You guys are going way too deep with this. The only people Trump "pays" to be there- as in guaranteed tickets etc - are veterans .  you really think his campaign pulls a Hillary? Has MSM infected the centipedes?
Yeah, many people in history have done their jobs right, for better or worse. Whether this is the best system or necessary isn't the point. The point is her ability to live comfortably with this, or even delight in the anecdote. And let's face it, were it Trump this would be headline news for months.

Why is Crooked Hillary never on Fox News to take tough questions? Trump is on every network, almost every day, even when he knows he will get tough questions. 
Trump said that he hopes she stays spokeswoman because the more she talks the more votes he gets.
Hillary just sounds more and more ridiculous every time she speaks. Her holier-than-thou attitude is disgusting. She even thinks she can twist an FBI investigation to sound like it's nothing, makes up her own terms even, 'security inquiry' HA! I hope that pissed off the FBI and they investigate her even harder. All her flunkies sound dumb and keep getting BTFO. Im looking forward to when Trump becomes president and we put this mess of an election behind us and Shillary behind bars.

The deeper question here is, why is the chairwoman of the DNC defending Hillary, who is not even presumptive nominee yet? Can you imagine Rinsed Penis defending Trump like this a month ago against pretty much anything?

This makes it blatantly obvious the DNC is in $hill's corner. Just don't tell Berncucks; I am sick of hearing their false hopes.
When Trump said worse than waterboarding he meant an hour long lecture from this shrew, Elizabeth Warren and Hot Sauce Hillary.
Trump is the Shakespeare of twitter, every 140 character reply is an instant classic. 
The Onion was bought out by major Hillary investors. They probably think this is an attack and will hurt Trump.
Sorry, but that's such horseshit. I've written for the Onion on and off for over 10 years. All they care about is funny. They've never asked us to tailor our material. They're not trying to "hurt Trump" any more than they're trying to "hurt Clinton" with these articles.

Then I hope they attack every day! Attack often! Got nothing to see now that Trump ain't holding as many rallies as he used to - or at all.
Yes Jeb, Trump is going to insult the criminal establishment of the way to the Whitehouse. 
[Trump](http://imgur.com/VQCwxII.jpg)[2016](http://imgur.com/Ye3XXd2.jpg)
That because women currently get paid less = Donald Trump (through the eyes of those with a skewed interpretation of the wage gap) thinks women are inferior.


You really have to be on a fucked up wavelength to even comprehend how the thought process for anything with these people goes.
She's pointing this quote out as absurd which it is under liberal logic. To them women already work as hard as men and still make less so for Trump to say that would appear ignorant in their minds. It doesn't make sense to anyone whose not already committed to the liberal agenda. 
To understand it you first have to understand that Team Hillary actually fell for their own bullshit and really do believe in the wage gap myth. Going from there it's clear she is trying to insinuate that Trump thinks women should continue to make the same as they do now (less than men) if they do the same work. 

Now obviously since regular people don't live in the same bubble as Hillary and aren't surrounded by yes men, they're probably not going to go through all of her mental gymnastics to reach that conclusion and this will back fire on her.

In other words: Hillary needs to get out more.
That Trump is saying women make less because they don't do as good a job as men.

Despite studies into the real reasons.  It's bad logic and won't appeal to anyone but the hardcore subscribers to the Wage Gap.
Implying that Trump thinks women don't do as good a job already
Every single ad I've seen Hillary put out vs. Trump is an emotional appeal, totally devoid of either criticism of his policies or touting her own plans.  It all boils down to "WAAAAAAA!"
I think the stretch they are trying to make is to convince people that Trump thinks women "aren't doing as good of a job".
It's the best response Trump could've given. It lets him deflect any questions about pay inequality (a myth, but political suicide to acknowledge). He's not responsible for the "wage gap" but he implies that if there are companies who are doing this he may be willing to stand up for women

It's the worst response she could've given since it plays the woman card, again, and indicates to many that she doesn't believe women should be paid the same for doing the same job. Good thing her very own foundation proves this for us
I really don't think that is her point. Her point is that Trump thinks 'equal work = equal pay'. However the whole feministic, unequal pay problem is premised on the notion that a bunch of structural factors - outside of simply individual hard work - stop equal pay from being realized. These are things like the fact that women still stay home more than men and thus lose career chances, some fields have a boys club mentality making promotion less likely, women are looked down on and not given the same tasks to show improvement, and so on.

I am not saying I agree with the feminist position, but I am 99% that is the point H is trying to make :)
Let me see if I understand your theory: Essentially, Trump is clueless  because he is ignoring all of the injustice created in the real world by man's dominance in the workplace.   Very much similar to the hidden white privilege one experiences by being white. 
  
  

And I think the corollary to that is:

She's trying to say Trump is wrong about that supposed sentiment, and pay is still somehow disparate between men and women, and therefore affirmative steps need to be taken which favor women because despite equivalent competency women still can't break this fictitious ceiling that some people perceive.

Of course that is all pandering BS and she probably is entirely incapable of intelligently deciphering the real economic labor factors in play.
Followed up with "Donald Trump says he cherishes women"

Honestly what are these people thinking?
Doesn't need to say anything, the hard core believers take anything said about trump negatively.

Trump pets a puppy

Oh no trump hates kittens
Did you miss the "Time to start believing Trump's rhetoric" right below that one? 

This gotta be some kind of yuuuuge middle finger from Hillary campaign team to Hillary. They know Trump is right. They are smart cookies!
Well, they tried to push "Dangerous Donald". It's either a vast Trump+Illuminati conspiracy or the mind bending effects of high level meme magic fried their brains.
I loved that fued back in the day, I always hated rosie o'donnell and that was what, 10 years ago?  Trump dominated that one too.
Her daughter said that she is a fake, a slob, neglectful parent. And also that she abandoned her and did not help her during a drug  problem. But Rosie thought Trump was evil for giving Miss America another chance with her drug problem.

And Rosie calls Trump the evil one almost weekly. Of course, it is Trump that has 5 loving, loyal, humble, kind, not druggies,  well adjusted, and the older ones completely successful children. 

I have not heard about the alocoholism. But if i remember her daughter did say  Rosie drinks a lot of beer daily. 
"Trump’s plan for equal pay is simple: Women should just do as good of a job as men."

Wow what an offensive idea!
And people still think that Hillary legitimately has a chance at stumping Trump in November. LMAO. 
Shit's like dissing Dre. You try to stump Trump you just stump yo'self.
Some part of me wants to see an epic and tight race between Trump and Crooked Hillary.

But another part of me wants to see him completely stump her as early as June and then spend the next four or five months teasing her for fun as he did to Jeb.
Every day that Trump hammers Crooked Hillary makes it more likely the Democratic superdelegates are going to get nervous and flip to Bernie. 

I've said it before and I'll say it again:  Bernie Sanders has a better chance to beat Trump than Crooked Hillary. His supporters are far more enthusiastic and Clinton's are much more likely to vote for Bernie than flip and vote for Trump. 
MSM will try to make the General sound like a tight race.  But we want a blowout because landslide numbers for Trump = stronger mandate!
Its on her website as well... Under the "things people need to know about trump!!!111" area.

>**Trump thinks women should “do as good a job” as men if they want equal pay.**

>The average American woman working full time makes 79 percent of what men are paid—and it’s not because they aren’t working as hard. But responding to a question about equal pay, Trump said, “You’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.”

These people are certifiable.
According to the random bimbo I saw on twitter, this means Trump explicitly said that women are inferior to men because they never make the same amount as them. Sad!
Just wow. Hillary helping to red pill America accidentally for Trump. 

**My Emperor!** Your power is boundless!!! 
Trump’s plan: Women should just do as good of a job as men.
Hillary is a secret Trump plant designed to ruin the Democrat party.
Has to be, as that is either saying Trump is right and is for equal pay.... or she is for inequality and women are not equal.  Hilarious.  
"If you do as good a job you deserve equal pay" Pro-Trump posts posted directly by the competition.

hilarious
Her campaigns idea of turning Trumps words against him is obviously working out well for Trump! Lol. 

Either that or her Twitter staffer is secretly a centipede. 
Hillary: "Trump WANTS EQUALITY LOL WHAT A BIGOT"
Trump should retweet it.
Are we sure Hillary isn't a Trump plant? 
Male executives at the Clinton Foundation earn more than women, but male and female execs at the Trump Orginization are paid the same. What the heck, goys?
Donald Trump believes in equal rights for women and Hillary thinks that women should have more equality than that.
The only reason I can think of someone in Clinton's camp genuinely posting this is she's saying "hey guys, Trump says this but we all know that's not the way it is!"

No idea otherwise.
But...seriously.  Trump basically said 'Equal Pay for Equal Work' and they try to say 'look, look!  What a bad guy!'
HAHA!

Equal pay for equal work.

Thanks Hillary for converting more Trump supporters!
"Donald Trump says he cherishes' women"

"we should start believing Trump's rethoric"

Jesus christ this woman is incompetent. Not because she is female though don't get triggered
Every time Hillary opens her mouth, another person votes for Trump. 
Hills on the Trump Train now!
The debate writes itself!

Hillary: And Donald Trump's sexist remarks cannot stand! He says women will make the same pay if they do the same job!

Everybody: ....and?

And jesus, that tweet:

-Trump says women will get equal pay for equal work

-Trump cherishes women

-Time to believe what Trump says

Savage?
The DNC may just go with Bernie seeing how Trump is already dominating Clinton. 
I think she's _trying_ to say that Trump is saying that women currently make less because they don't do as good of a job, which is an offensive statement to women to claim they are not currently as hard of workers as men. But I'm honestly not 100% that that is how she is trying to spin it.
lol, that line was used on the wild shill that appeared in Can't stump the Trump 4.


If anything, this only shows me that Trump sees women as equals to men.
They've been so brainwashed by their own rhetoric to think that Trump's a misogynist that literally anything he says related to women is automatically assumed to be an insult.

"I love all women"

BREAKING: Trump wants to sexually assault all women!
Hmm, my take on it is she's implyng that Mr. Trump thinks women who make less than men don't do as good a job.
Well, the implication of what Trump said is that women in general *aren't* doing as good a job as men (as evidenced by the fact they are paid less). And that's kind of an offensive thing to say.
Isn't the implication that since women make 75 cents on the dollar that every man makes for the same job at the same level, that Trump is saying women are paid that amount because they currently AREN'T doing as good of a job as their male coworkers?
(Edit: wooorrrdsss)
It was probably done by their professional chef to make sure it looks perfect. Under Trump we should train all cooks to be chefs. 

**Make Our Food Great Again**
It's just like Scott Adams said, everybody complained about what he did, but in the end all that remains in people's minds is Trump smiling, eating tacos and saying "I love hispanics"
Outraged facebook/twitter liberals unknowingly make up half of Trump's supporter base. 
As a legal Hispanic centipede, I have to say it's more how angry we get for illegal immigrants coming in and taking jobs. 

Since many Hispanics are immigrants, they also do understand how having borders and the protection of the country isn't racist. And since we're a minority, "we can't be racist" apparently. 

"Why do you support Trump?" Someone asked me

"Because he can **MAGA**"

"But you're a Latino!"

"Yes, but I'm an American first!" That seems to anger people for some reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Thank you. You'd be doing us and yourself a favor by sharing my story with your friends who may be against the idea of Trump. This sentence sums it up: Either you're for Trump, or you hate America.
We waited 2 years just to get a phone call about an interview. Then it took another 2 years to go through all the interviews/medical screenings, blood tests, etc... Then we found out we were accepted and we were moving. 

Cue lots of crying and leaving everything and everyone you love behind. Only my parents, my little sister, and myself were coming here. When we got here, we didn't know english. My dad found a job (not a lavish job: physical labor stuff) within 3 weeks so our food stamps were taken away. Mom worked night shift on the kill floor at a meat processing plant. Very nasty work. 

I was just looking at old pictures from 16 years ago, and they had me crying. My parents eyes looked dead. The bags under their eyes were really bad. You can literally see the toll that the stress took on them. My sister and I were pretty young when we arrived. She was 2 and I was 9.

Anyways, back to how long it took to get settled.. We lived at those first apartments for about a year before we moved into some nicer ones. We lived at the new ones for about 2 years before my parents were able to afford a mortgage. Keep in mind that we only came here with 4 luggage bags of clothes and $30 that my cousin gave us because he had some American money.

We were naturalized about 6-7 years after we arrived. Now we're proud citizens and we will be voting for Trump come November. Fuck these illegals undermining everything my family had to endure. And fuck Hillary. And fuck Mark Cuckerberg.

Ask away if you have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer
Thank you so much, I (we) really appreciate that. I hope you share my story with your friends, especially if they're against Trump. That man is a blessing from the heavens. Without him we'd be stuck with establishment assholes who only want to Globalize the world into misery. 
Asylum because religious persecution by muslims in Bosnia. We're catholic. As soon as these snakes have the majority, it's game over.

Three big reasons why I'm voting for Trump:

* Illegal immigration needs to stop

* Muslims should not be taken in by the thousands (they're not our friends, believe me)

* Gun rights

This is the huge difference in this poll  - of course nearly every single illegal immigrant hates Trump, but when you ask legal immigrants/registered Hispanic voters, it's a much different story... 
Not entirely true. There's a HUGE segment of uneducated Hispanics where I'm from (Texas) that believes Trump is the boogeyman; a racist here to rid the US of Hispanics such as ourselves. It's the narrative pushed by the media and social media. I'm Hispanic, and have to correct some family members' assumption that we'll be in some sort of trouble if Trump gets elected. My son even asked me about it because that's what he heard from some other 7th graders. I told him he is 4th generation Texan, he ain't goin' fuckin ANYwhere. (I did also explain how immigration and the media works). 

Anyway, sounds silly, but it's amazing what people will believe. 
This. My legal cousins hate Trump and are all "Viva La Raza". They would consider me dead to them if they knew I supported Trump.

My husband is Caucasian and his ignorant stepmother supports Killary. She was surprised that I, being Hispanic, would support Trump.

Bitch, I'm 5th generation Texan coming from a long line of American relatives who served their country in WW2 and Vietnam. What a dumb cunt.

That's just unfounded. Nate is probably the leading political statistician that's creating work for public consumption (not inside a campaign). He's incredibly intellectually honest and outside of missing in Trump this election cycle, he's essentially always right on the money. 
I read their website sometimes but mostly listen to every episode of their political podcast. In their most recent podcast episode they talk about why did they get Trump so wrong. In my opinion, they didn't scratch the surface of the true reason because it's kind of embarrassing in a way that only the truth can be: the data is not as impartial as they think it is and they aren't either, the way they interpret it bends it to what they want to happen.

So for the past two presidential election cycles, they wanted Obama to win. As a result, they gave credibility to polls that predicted Obama would win, and bent the data in the direction of Obama winning. So polls that tried to convince everyone that Obama's win was assured got higher credibility notes. The thing is, Obama was actually going to win, so it seemed like magic.

The spell is broken the moment the thing you want to happen does not coincide with what actually is going to happen. Clearly, Nate Silver & friends did not, in any way, shape or form, want Trump to win. They would look for clues where there was none, to find ways by which Trump was losing ground, or was doomed, or had a ceiling... whatever they could come up with. Trump had to lose, and they had to be the first to explain why.

In my opinion, 538 is a very young website and to be quite honest they still have a chance to survive this embarrassment. What they need to do is recognize the above and act in a way to become not a liberal think tank, but a diverse space for debate. Every time I listen to their podcast I imagine there's an extra voice there saying Trump will win it all, another voice saying Sanders has a strong chance, another voice saying Cruz could have made it if he had done this or that. Their podcast, as it stands, is for liberals who want to listen to a reassuring voice telling them Trump is dumb and Hillary will win, just like it was a reassuring voice telling liberals not to worry because Obama had it in the bag. The next level for them is to let in people with other opinions, so that they can have an actual debate about polls and data. Everyone is so deferential to each other that it gets kind of pointless.

The reason why I listen to it is because I'm always interested in the enemy's reasonings, but frank debate between worthy adversaries would be even better.
Pretty big miss though especially when everybody could see Trump would be the nominee after South Carolina. After every victory the guy was going through hoops trying to explain why Trump would imminently fall. Sometimes you have to look beyond the numbers and gauge the mood of the country and I think a good predictions guy would know that. 
You may think that's true--but that's not how data-based research works. His work is a combination of "polls only" projections and "polls plus" (which is weighted polls plus the census breakdown of the area and how those groups typically vote). 

And, while many people in this sub believed Trump has been "inevitable", the data has not fully backed that up. 

If you listen to his podcast he occasionally admits he missed on Trump, he doesn't run from it. 
The problem is that most polls at that time showed Trump ahead. Silver did what he used to argue against in 2012 - he didn't believe the data, so he massaged it with this polls-plus BS until it looked like he wanted it to.
He missed Trump for month after month in spite of the polls (which are data). IIRC he got last UK election wrong. 
Even if it's not a great poll, it's a data point. Look for other, better polls to replicate and then you'll know it's for real. For instance multiple polls now show high double digit black support for Trump.

Edit: sorry, not high double digit obviously - high teens.
Probably more important are polls on minority support in states actually up for grabs. For example it's not highly useful for Trump if he has decent support from Hispanics if the bulk of the support from Hispanics for Trump is coming from
Texas, a state that is going to go red regardless. 
That would likely mean Trump is actually doing better than the poll says.
In truth, most of their state projections were pretty accurate. They just get a lot of shit because they ignored the polls early on and assumed Trump's support would decline like the early front runners in 2012.
I agree. It is definitely good news to see support for Trump in any capacity from the Hispanic population. The media appears to be writing them off as a punted demographic. 
[watch the short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Y7cA8w6Hk)

Shillary is still up and in the lead above Trump. But he's gaining traction while she's losing ground. She still hasn't even secured her primary yet. Trump has. Trump also hasn't even started on her. Once she's officially the nominee he's going to nuke the shit out of her and it will be glorious. 
I figure Trump hasn't truly started on Hillary yet because she hasn't secured her nomination yet.

Is there any chance that Hillary is stalling with her primary, because she knows that as long as Bernie is technically in the race, Trump will hold off and wait?  She might be deliberately underperforming in the primary to shield herself from Trump.
Trump already started on her. Haven't you been paying any attention?
I truly believe Trump will be out 45th president. 
His team is taking a very measured approach to this.  They know Trump needs to unite the GOP behind him before he goes after Hillary.  He'll deride her in interviews, sure, but his focus is to make sure the party doesn't splinter.
Nobody blows massive leads like Hillary. She's done is every single time. First against Obama in 2008, then against Bernie, and now against Trump. She starts off with massive leads almost entirely due to name recognition, and then when people actually start paying attention her leads drop to nothing. 
**"You see this watch, Bernie?  This watch cost more than your car.  I made 30,000,000 dollars last year, how much you make?  You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.  Nice guy?  I don't give a shit.  Good father?  Fuck you!  Go home and play with your kids.  You want the White House - close!  You think this is abuse?  You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?  You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get in the White House?!  You don't like it, leave."**

-  Glengarry Glen Trump 
She doesn't even have a massive lead in front of Trump. The only thing she has an actual large lead on is black voters. 
Yeah that's what I mean... she managed to blow twenty-point leads on both Obama and Bernie, so people are insane if they thought she was going to be able to hang on to a shitty six point lead in front of Trump. It's only going to get worse for her. She has zero mojo and zero momentum. 
She's actually already blown a bunch of her lead on Trump, she was leading by over 30 points a few months ago.
Is it over? Trump could also get 15% of the black vote when the Democrats need like 90%.
AFAIK the last polls had Trump at 18-20%
Still don't get why blacks don't like Trump? Never said anything negative about them? 
Most people are just starting to pay attention to the race. They haven't had enough direct exposure to Trump to reject the image the media been pushing. Give it time.
**Conditioning. Decades of Democratic, and liberal media race baiting.** 

Taking away personal responsibility, and personal empowerment. Create false narratives that white people are all racist, or evil. That white cops are hunting them on the streets. That white people are responsible for all their obstacles/wrongs in life,  but also that the Democratic party is their savior or caretaker. 

Same to latinos like me. Creating a permanent victimhood mentality. 

**We vote democrat out of default. Out of "feelings".** 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most, than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.**

In this election cycle the liberal media knew Trump would be very popular with ALL people if they were actually truthful and fair in their reporting. So 8 months ago they ramped up their liberal race baiting bullshit. Every action Trump, they paint as him being personally racist. 

If some racist shook his hand one time, then Trump is racist. If some racist said he liked Trump, then Trump is racist. 

And they been doing this for months. While never even giving fair coverage. For instance, one thing you will never SEE is the black and white person hugging happily at a Trump rally. Or the black pastors introducing Trump to the cheer of thousands of white people. 

But if some fight broke out because some thug started, then liberal media will spend 1 month on that manipulating that white people are beating up black people at Trump rallies. 

For instance, Trump has thrown out like 98% white people out of his rallies for starting agigation, or bullshit. Media never mentions that. 

But he throws out 1 black person. And the media spends another month on that covering it daily that Trump is racist. 

So its been complete garbage race baiting, and manipulation by our liberal media, and the Democratic politicians. 

I mean, Hillary and Bernie dont even skip a beat and just call Trump racist, or bigoted. But they cant really point to 1 racist thing he has said or done, without misrepresenting, misquoting, or not giving the full paragraph. 

So its complete race baiting garbage. The true racist now, are our liberal media, and the Democratic party. 

They knew, that if honest, and fair, Trump beats Hillary easily. So they been purposefully poisoning latinos and blacks against him. To vote hillary. 

Kind of disgusting really. 
If Trump gets under 20 I'll be shocked.
Name for me the last rap song Reagan was name-dropped in.

Name for me a single political candidate pushing a better jobs program for black Americans than Trump.

He can do it. If the black community doesn't back Trump, it just shows they deserve to get fucked. He's literally trying to roll back the most harmful policies towards them.
That's why I thought he'd go with Ben Carson as VP - VPs don't do much anyway and it would potentially help Trump get in the WH
I'll take a dead Trump and another Iraq war please, mmm great compromise
Thanks. We can't let our fellow Trump supporters look like retards prime for stereotyping by the libs.

#**If Trump gets 55% of Hispanics in Florida and Cali...my god...

**GG Hillary. You tried.**
Not a fucking chance. I'm the biggest Trump fan there is but anyone who thinks he can take Cali is delusional.
At the rate he is gaining minority support? Absolutely. The black vote will be split at least. I've never met a black person who does not support Trump UNLESS they are convinced he is a racist.
Donald Trump can never win the Republican nomination, he is not a neocon and not part of the establishment.
Dems usually get around 90% of the black vote every election, actually making them less than 50 is basically impossible. Trump winning the nomination was obvious from the start.

I'm actually expecting Trump to be more popular with African-Americans than Bernie was. This is anecdotal, but when I was in the Bernie camp and was doing some phonespanking before South Carolina, TONS of blacks told me their problem with Bernie was that he had no balls -- they didn't respect all that groveling-nice-guy bullshit (pretty much the same thing I heard in Iowa from Indies who had switched from Bernie to Trump after the first Democratic debate). I heard from more Trump supporters in South Carolina than Bernie supporters, shocking considering that it was a Dem phone database.
Hilary will win southern blacks, they always vote democratic as a bloc.  Trump will heavily exceed expectations with black men outside the south, maybe even win or at least break even, while I expect black women to stick with Hilary.  
Since Hillary's so anxious to give Trump a nickname too, here's a good one:

#LANDSLIDE DONALD
Trump radiates,  as the sun! 

I love you Trump! 

**MAGA!** mis latinos AMERICANOS!

\#**NotMyAbuela**
The biggest thing to take away from these recent polls is that Crooked Hillary is trending down and Trump is on the rise.  Trump will do very well with Hispanics and blacks.  Both cultures generally favor strength and boldness.  Hillary panders to them, treats them like children.  Trump is upfront with them and speaks of his love for all Americans.  Trump actually wants to unite the country while Crooked Hillary is working on keeping the division. 
How long has the media trying to brand Trump as a racist to deny him the minority demographics?

All in vain, nothing sticks to him. Teflon-Don is standing tall, no backtracking, no compromise. 
B-but I thought Trump was a racist and hated mexicans... are you telling me that not all mexicans are illegal? 
"If I get the nomination I'll win the latino vote, I will win it, because I will create jobs." - Donald J. Trump, the God Emperor
I'll see you in four years, When Trump decide he'll need a moat to go with the wall.
Gonna wait for a more highly rated poll.  This goes against most polls and favorables we've seen.  Most hispanics(outside Texas/Florida) are liberal.  If Trump hits 50%+ of Hispanics it'd be a landslide.  
 Even with like 20 percent and the increased white vote Trump can win easily.  I predict he will get about 15-20 percent of the black vote as well
That's not good, because that poll still shows Hillary leading.  Trump should be up by a lot with those kinds of Hispanic numbers.
Any other Democratic candidate available would have given Trump a good fight.

With Crooked Clinton, this is going to be like Trump fighting an already punch drunk stroke victim 
They didn't poll me. But, I'm Puerto Rican and I tell you, I know many hispanics that are for Trump. Including my mom~ 
Oh my God,  I just am getting giddy imaging the meltdowns and rationalizations if Trump won the hispanic vote. Bahahahahah
¡Viva Trump!
Of course CNN this morning had a headline "Trump's latino problem"
Hopefully Hispanics will see that Trump is about giving them jobs and enforcing the border rather than falling for the Hildabeast's pandering.
If this is true, then Trump will be the next president of the United States. We can just skip the elections.
The problem is the media, activists and the politicians have fooled themselves into believing Hispanics are one homogeneous group or race of people that can be controlled politically.That ignorance will cost the Dems votes and Trump will do better than everyone is expecting with Hispanic voters.
I am confused and could have sworn he wouldn't win this demographic. Can someone explain to me why Hispanic voters are backing Trump?
Because polls consistently show Trump has Hispanic disapproval at around 80%. I love the man but there's no way this poll is accurate. 
She also said she wouldn't lose to our Lord and savior Trump

I don't know what would trigger liberal feminist cucks more, the photos of trump or the 3 clean cut, good looking FUCKING WHITE MALES doing the Trumping.  
I actually voted for Donald Trump in the March Primary. At this time in high school the majority of students are 18. 
I think it's more about those who just claim to be trans to get special privilege. Like that werecamel that spit on the Trump supporter then immediately said "don't hit me I'm trans"
#We get both Rocky and Rambo on the Trump Train for the price of one!
Rambo would definitely be a Trump supporter because Trump supports the vets. 
Don't forget Marion Cobretti, Judge Dread, and Tango... or Cash... I can never remember who was who in that one. I just hope Kurt Russell is for Trump too so it won't matter. 
Trump will enforce the *luaaaaaaw*
Crime is the disease. Trump is the cure.
Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character. One of them takes a nuanced approach and pokes fun at himself during it, while the other gets on a soapbox about refugees. I guarantee none of those refugees will be anywhere near his mountainside mansion in Italy.  
> Man, compare this statement on Trump to Clooney and it tells you everything about their character.

"We will not be governed by fear" said the nervous man failing to form coherent sentences while he attempts to create mass hysteria over patriotism.
As they do nothing but try to make people fearful of a Trump presidency.  They are everything that they rail against.  
For having made a career glorifying gun violence, Stallone is *massively* anti-gun. He has, publicly, advocated for door-to-door confiscation of all guns. Great that he's pro-Trump, but I have a hard time applying positive terms to the guy.
Stallone: Alpha male, confident, successful, very well-liked, social.. I can see why he'd like someone who reminds him of himself. 

I am happy to see new or existing Trump supporters pick up the positive vibe from Trump and his supporters. I feel like we're all trying to make ourselves and our country better as a team. 


Look not everyone is going to agree with everyone about every issue. Mr. Rocky sees what needs to be done to make America great again. And we should be happy that he supports Trump.
Anyone have a for/against(empty threat to leave the country) Trump list of celebrities?

She gave us money just for you. Can you post more anti-Trump ones, please? We just want to keep things civil. Seriously. Please?"*
He was praying to God, that Trump would let it slide, but he knew deep down inside, he wouldn't.
Problem is the journalist doesn't realize Trump is the God Emperor. When he prays to God, Trump hears it.
That was some Rocky uppercut he gave him. 

Trump does not react how all these snakes expect. They expect him to cower, and fall. But he does NOT.  
It is a terrible line of questioning and Stephanopoulos knows it.  Trump knows it.  Tax returns are not important.  These "hard" questions are all lightweight gossip that pretend to be important political questions because people who watch these shows want their news to sound scandalous.

Stephanopoulos should quit.  His heart is barely in it anyways and this sort of show is beneath him.  Trump has to call in to this shit, so I don't blame him.  Transgendered bathrooms?  Tax returns?  This is the President of the United States.

The only time shows like this work is when the host is crazy as shit, and that only lasts for a while.  Chris Matthews had a pretty good run until everyone realized what a narcissistic nut he was and Rachel Maddow had the same short run until people realized how far off the deep end she really was.
He's a donor to the Clinton Foundation, he worked for the Clintons, and he's a "former" Democratic Party political consultant.   

This goes to show just how biased our media can be, and how much Trump isn't afraid of anyone in the media.  He went on here knowing this and slapped that man bitch upside the head.  


Seriously, Trump has some big balls doing that interview with that biased piece of shit. 
I'm glad that Trump mentioned it. Otherwise a lot of young Hillary followers might not realize that. Probably won't make a difference to them though.
I think this needs to be brought up every single time he's interviewing Trump, because so many millennials have no idea who he is and think he's an actual journalist.

I love this dom-reddit so much.
Is isn't a secret.  He wrote a book about his time with the Clintons.  It is a great read and it will get quoted by Trump this summer.

Stephanopoulos has been working hard to look like a tough reporter for years.  Tim Russert completely dominated when he was on Meet the Press and George has never shaken off the fact that his own Sunday morning show was second best.

He is seen as a bit of a lightweight and it seems to make him act more aggressive than he should.  It is sad.  His passive aggressive comments make him look weak and it has always been apparent that he lacks the ability to get people to follow up on their answers.

Stephanopoulos is a smart guy.  He shouldn't be interviewing political candidates.  He will never be Tim Russert.  He is a solid writer in a world that needs better written political news.
They're obviously trying to create the same rich guy not paying his fair share narrative they did with Romney, it won't work with Trump.  That one comment just ended that, "I try to pay as little as possible because our government is so wasteful".  

Done, he took all their ammo away with that one line.  It's beautiful to watch. 
Look at that woman's face after he calls her out for asking about that tape, she's embarrassed and ashamed.  Not because she came to the realization that it was in fact completely retarded to even bring it up much less continue to ask about it, but because Trump made her look like an idiot when she really believed she had a real gotcha.  

I love it.  Trump just owns these people.  

Edit:  I'm so busy trying to MAGA I got my threads mixed up.  Video I was referencing.

They call Trump populist in a pejorative way, but when somebody brings up shit like fucking Transgender bathrooms, he basically says "I don't give a shit". That's not populism, folks.  
It's because even the corrupt DNC fucks know they can't use "The War On Women" attack on Trump.

So now they are trying the tranny bathroom social wedge.

It won't work. Even gays and lesbians who haven't drank the social justice cancer kool aids are getting tired of the tranny bs.
It's literally never been an issue before people just did what they wanted and now they're trying to start issues that they think democrats can win, but we've got the God-Emperor on our side and he can't be stumped. In 2012 they eventually made a huge deal about women's issues since most people didn't agree with Romney on it (despite the fact he wasn't trying to change things in that regard) and he just fell into their trap. This is them manufacturing another trap except Trump is too smart for them! He won't play their games!

Although personally I do think Obama crossed a line, because kids in elementary and middle school shouldn't just use whatever bathroom they feel like because they aren't mature enough to make such decisions about their identity. And I do not trust 10 year old boys to not play pranks using this to their advantage.
Transgender people have been, and will continue to use, the "wrong" bathroom no matter what the law is, simply because most of them pass as that gender. It would only make things more complicated when a "man" who follows the letter of the law gets arrested for using the lady's room and making them uncomfortable.

What's most unfortunate is that the Religious Right doesn't care if the law is illogical, or an example of Big Government imposing their will onto the people. They took the liberal bait on this issue anyway. They have made conservatism a laughing stock for the past two decades and it's about damn time for somebody like Trump to reform the party away from legislating social values and back into fiscal conservatism and smaller government.
**You just saw some true shit American liberal media.**

Look at the headline. Like Trump is required to release his. They try to make it sound nefarious. 

Then they juxtapose Trump and Hillary at same time. Hillary shaking hands with a black person. Trump with white people. 

**Race baiting pieces of shit**. They will never show the black pastors that always introduce Trump. They will never show 1 black, or minority person even 10 meters near him.  They will never show the latino happy with Trump. Or that latina hugging him. 

And remember....this is an actual strategy used by our liberal media. Their producers. Their orders. To not show Trump with any minority. To point the camera away, or NOT use any footage with Trump with a black person if they can help it. And always try to get Hillary picture with black person, or a muslim. They do it with Bernie too. They will show him with minorities. 

And ask yourself why is this? Its to race bait, to manipulate latinos like me, and blacks. Into being subconciously bias against Trump. 

So you ask yourself who the TRUE racist are. It is now the Democratic Party. And our liberal media. 

It is the Democratic party, and the liberal media that divides us now. By race.  Making us think we are all not Americans first. All for the vote. 
I do wonder why, at Trump rallies, all the people behind him are always white.  I'm a strong DJT supporter but he would be smart to put minorities behind him at those rallies -- then the MSM would have no choice but to show that minorities support him.
That is race baiting. Thats what Democrats do now. They hand select. Trump has minorities at his rallies. But he does not do what the true racist do: Democratic handlers hand select the black kid, or the muslim, and pick as many as they can, to put them behind them, and have the nice "progressive" photo op. 

Of course they make it like its some "inclusion" happy unity of love by giving them front and centre. 

You think its just organically and accidentally that you see Hillary or Bernie with the black person behind them, or muslim, or latino etc every single time?

#HotSauceInHerPurse

Nope. Its them creating the "good optics"

Trump does not give a fuck if you are white, asian, black, latino at his rally. 

The sad thing is, latinos like me, blacks, are so brainwashed by this that we dont even realize it. This type of pandering is done so much by liberal media, and democrats, that they probably dont even see anything wrong with it.

Or they do, and are just snake racist fucks about it. The Democratic party, and liberal media treats blacks and latinos in America, like their puppies: To race bait. To frighten and anger against White people. To create a victimhood mentality. So that we vote for the good Democrats to "save us" against the evil white Republicans. 

**There is nothing that the Democratic party fears most,  than latinos like me, and blacks, taking/finding personal responsibility for our own lives. And feeling like we are American first. Before latino, or before black. If this happened, nobody would ever vote Democrat again, and the democratic party would never win another election.** 
I'm not talking "pandering" -- but Trump needs to expose the MSM for the lying assholes that they are.  Putting minorities (at least SOME) behind him at rallies shows he does have minority support.   It is called "marketing" -- something Trump is a genius in!
I think if you truly believe in equality like Trump does than it doesn't matter who the fuck is sitting behind him.  The people sitting behind him are all Americans.
Thats awesome. I have never even heard of him. Goes to show you CNN wont be giving that guy many interviews to talk about why he likes Trump. 

No, but they will spend 3 weeks on him saying "2nd" corinthians, instead of "two". Or they will spend 2 months on some bullshit that some racist might like Trump.

Of course, they never will mention Senator Robert Byrd and the Clintons all that much. And if do, it will be with them excusing it always. Or EVER show Hillaries actual racist joke "colored people time" on CNN that much. No. They will hide, and protect that as much as possible, and shit like that with everybody else that happens too.   
Once you awake to the liberal media its pretty obvious. Its same reason why they also hand select interviews. You think they will interview any latino that likes Trump? They were not even showing them, till like 1 month ago. No, but all liberal media will go out of its way to find some bad apple. Like some actual racist. Not very well educated maybe. And thats all they will hand select. Bad apples. And make it seem that Trump is only supported by their race baiting bullshit. The "kkk, white nationalist" etc. 

But our liberal media will NEVER interview anybody like this:

Or show you this:

Except that Trump and his kids are all highly educated...
Stephanopoulos keeps asking about Trump's tax returns, Trump calls Hillary out about emails and Goldman & Sachs speeches
Do these idiots not understand that this just comes across as petty whining? The average voter doesn't give a crap about tax returns unless they contain something illegal (which the government would pounce on anyway). We already know Trump is rich and hates paying taxes, these aren't some astounding revelations.
They're good for seeing tax rate, but Trump just said he tries to pay the lowest tax rate. The benefit of not being a Democratic cunt who keeps harping on about "need to pay the fair share"
As a _Forensic_ accountant, I disagree. But just the same, I'm not a fan of this trend of forcing people who want to run for office to release their tax returns, and the general overall culture of "public office = no private life". I'm kinda enthused Trump is going to do it _on his terms_ and no one else's. President Backbone. 

I think donor lists and disclosures of related parties are more important than tax returns. 
Trump probably did, he holds the Guinness record for biggest financial turn around in history.
That shit eating tone. As if you were anointed as an authority of any type. All the questions where non issues and I have never seen $hillary Clinton call in and get incoming like Trump did. 

Yea George let's talk about how your bitch is missing emails, goldman sachs speeches, and has a major impending documentary about to destroy your phoney little mandate. 

These holier than thou', Liberal cucktard reporters.  Grasping for anything they think will hurt Trump.  

**Trump steel won't bend or break.**
#MAGA
Fuck you, Georgie. You don't get the fucking tax returns until the audit is over. How many times does Trump need to tell you? It's his choice and you don't get to fucking make it.
Pretty sure this is gonna end up on a Can't Stump The Trump video
Clinton released all the e-mails she had in her possession. No shit she did because she didn't delete fast enough. 

What a dickhead and you jus noticed by Trump's tone of voice he had a nuke ready and at the last second before they cut him off BANG. 
Let's all acknowledge that it's definitely Trump on that tape, it's totally deniable, it's hilarious, and nobody cares.
Fuck Stephanopoulos! He just learned that he can't stump the Trump!
I love how Trump called him out on being a Hillary follower.   These MSM assholes pretend that they are "fair" when they have an agenda.  Good for you DJT!
Trumps a counter puncher. He's been planning this for years, to think he didn't see releasing his tax returns would be an issue, underestimates Trump. This is a classic move to get the opponent to over extend and set themselves up for a counter punch. 
Holy shit.  Literally six minutes of just attacking him on tax returns and Trump had to keep giving the same answer.  Really productive George.
WTF.... A 6 minute interview, and all this liberal shill does is ask about taxes for the entire interview. No questions about real issues. The people don't give a fuck about Trump's taxes. 

Trump has been in the public eye for decades now, and this idiot thinks he's going to learn something new from a few IRS forms. 

No one cares, George.... You're a fucking shill for your former employer....

Once again, Trump gives an interview, which he knows is going to be a hostile one, and Trump totally destroys the shill.


This was amazing. Trump is exactly what the Republican party has been needing for a long time, someone that isn't afraid of the media and calls them out on their bullshit. 
I'm done caring about how people will percieve if I am voting for Trump. This interview is so full of hipocrary from the communist cucks, it's **UNBELIEVABLE.** 

#MAGA
It amazes me that these mediaite fuckwits still think this sort of bullshit will work. 

1 - Trump destroys pansies like this guy and turns "the narrative" back around on them. 

2 - In case they haven't noticed, the ''''experts'''' and ''''journalists'''' have been wrong on everything this election season. The Silent Majority has had it. There is nothing they can do or say that will have any impact whatsoever. They have been utterly exposed. Serves the pieces of shit right. 
Trump is the ONLY candidate who has the balls to be interviewed by the enemy. Plain and simple.
Serious question. How in the fuck does he have a job as a journalist? 

How? 

It's fucking embarrassing ABC. This is the interview and he soaks the entire time up blathering about Trump's tax returns. Suck a fucking joke. 

Fire him. Fire him
Trump  is not pandering to formality while Hillary is actually breaking laws...
I don't even get what Stephanopoulos was angling for. Getting Trump to agree to release his tax returns on air? An admission that he has billions stashed in off-shore accounts, as if it would matter if he did when it's not breaking the law and I assume every rich person in this country does? And what was that shit at the end with trying to insist that Clinton's emails had all been released? Right from the beginning, we knew she'd deleted tens of thousands of messages she considered "personal", and just this week we found out that her IT guy had scrubbed all of his correspondence with her. What a fucking shill.
Am I the only one who wants Trump to release his tax returns just so they STFU about it? I don't care if it's revealed he has a 0% tax rate, I'm still going to vote for him. He isn't a bad guy for taking advantage of a horrendously broken system. 
Fuck this guy. The whole interview was Trump proving him wrong and him constantly trying to make Trump look like a bad guy.
I love how Trump goes after media corruption/bias like no one else 
Speaking of the morning media, how do you daytime news crew lads handle this shit? I have CNN on at work today, and it's right now two SJWs melting down. This one woman is melting down not understanding that a proposal and a suggestion are synonymous.

They both hate Trump to a level that's just hilarious. Condemning the tapes with a guy with a New York accent (sounded like Queens) as OBVIOUSLY TRUMP!!
Trump BTFO that fucking white male Stephanopoulos.
Not influenced by any media other than Reddit. I would vote Bernie if I could and if he won't make it my vote 100% goes out to Trump. No way in hell I'd let $Hillary win.
Yeah in my opinion Bernie could give the country what it needs most, improvements on the schoolsystem and fucking over those corupt polliticians. Now im sure Trump would love to fuck over the corrupt aswell, but I am still afraid he has a hidden agenda. I'm sure its nowhere near Hillary's but I can't help but believe he'll do his best to fuck over his company's competitors. I also find it rlly weird someone with a big franchise can become.president. I mean, conflict of interest hello? And lets be fair, Bernie is just an old man that really tries to do what is best. I don't see what could go wrong when an old rational man is president. You wouldn't see him insult some Egyptian politician but I wouldn't be so sure with Trump and his Alpha Man attitude.

And finally I preffer a nice old man instead of a guy that already has everything... that sounded better in my head but im leaving it as is.
Yah I guess we both want the same thing but in different ways.  I think trump removing common core will improve the school system better than flooding the market with college degrees but starting education from the earliest point improvements.  How you feel about Trumps agenda I feel about Bernies Marxist Ideology.  Countries ran with Marxist ideology have all failed while the US has lasted for 4 times longer than them.  The reason all these elite figures are against Trump and not Bernie is that Trump knows we are being ripped off and wants to do something about it while they want to continue ripping us off.  I think you should reconsider what nice means.  It wont matter if he is nice if our country is getting ripped off.  There is a reason for the statement nice guys finish last.  Anyway I respect your opinion and am glad you are at least not deluded enough to think Hillary is the 2nd best option after Sanders. 
Its cool to be able to talk to someone that support Trump, heck just anyone on this sub, that isn't a troll or anything. Over the past few weeks I have quiete changed my perspective on Trump (in a good way). Think it came after he started talking like a nornal person after he realized he had already won his party's race. I agree with you on the ripping off part but I feel like Bernie will fight that more. And with everything related people's money (taxes, minimum wage etc.) I feel like Bernie has nothing to lose as he is just an old man with a clean record that seems to rlly fight for what is morally right. With Trump idk. He still has his business so now way he would do anything that would benefit the people but screw over his business. And Trump has also done a lot of asshole things even bfore his presidential run so that also rubs me the wrong way
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/12/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-jeff-sessions-editorials-debates/84298310/  I think you will enjoy this article.  One thing about Trump is unlike wallstreet billionares Trump's business depends on how well the U.S is doing since he is in real estate biz.  That's why I wouldn't be too concerned about Trump screwing people over.  The most he could do to improve his business would be to make the U.S stronger since it will improve the U.S real estate business and property value.  Glad your mind is open to Trump.  The mainstream media is literally trying to brainwash the populace with sound bite propaganda.  Their ultimate goal is to get someone in the US presidency that will pass TPP.  If TPP is passed then U.S sovereignty will no longer exits.
I love how Trump just slays him when he tries to use the liberal bullshit to his point across. That would have stumped any other politician. Not Trump, he says nope, 20,000 emails are missing, and you used to work for hildawg. So take your bitch ass back to her and visit her in jail Ms. Step-in-hillarys-pussy-poulos.   
Cuckhanopoulos steamrolled by Trump (AGAIN) 
I really don't understand why the media keeps pushing this tax return issue. I don't care what his tax returns says. He's rich. He's build an empire. He gives to a lot of charities and just admitted he tries to get the lowest tax rate. Which I respect. He's a great business man. Tell me one American that doesn't try to get the most back out of their tax returns. Instead this dumb ass news caster spent 5 mins repeating the same question. "It's none of your business" -Trump. He shut it down! 
Trump speak to the 4th wall to us regular Americans and it freaks the fuck out of inside players. They the insiders know the system is corrupt to the core and  fear what will happen when the American people realize it and mobilize for real change.
I honestly might vote for Trump just because of how funny the phrase "schlonging cucks" is.
I was a trump supporter (small t) prior to this morning, but what the hell just happened on GMA this morning made me a Mega TRUMP supporter.  Finally a man that has something hanging between his legs and can tell it how it is, not that he has not been doing this all along, but hey, way to shut up snuffaluffagas.  You have my vote Mr Trump.
Snuffleupagus tried to stump Trump, but he got himself stumped.
Trump is fearless.
I wonder if Hillary would agree to be interviewed by Hannity? The fact that Trump does this live says a lot about his ability.
Lol. They had 7 minutes to interview Trump and they spent the entire thing grilling him on his tax returns? Just lol.
This interviewer trying to trap Trump but got stumped instead. What a cuck. This is why the people think the news media is like 7% believable because they try to spin and deflect so hard. 
I can't believe Stepnfetchitopolous tried to Stump The Trump. 
Release your tax returns

My Lawyer says no

Well Nixon released them many years ago

Well Nixon did build a company worth 10 billion dollars.

Everyone has released but Trump

One the audit is done

But Hillary released some of her e-mails

Jesus fucking christ.
Why not release them during the audit though? What could be an issue?

I loved how he said he pays as little as he can taxes wise though. No other candidate can say that shit and Trump owns the fuck out of it.

So much respect.
Why won't Donald Trump release his tax returns if they're as boring as he says they are?
Ps. Being under audit is irrelevant.
Trump is at his best in these combative interviews. Stephanopoulos is a slimy little piece of shit but that seems to bring out Trump's A game.
> He threw a fit because he got caught regarding his tax returns. Why the fuck would this make you proud to be a supporter?

"caught"?

He's saying the same thing he's said since the beginning - that once the audit is done, he'll release them. Only an idiot would release them before an audit is finished.

Step tried to be a smarmy bitch and demanded to know the marginal tax rate in a clear attempt to say Trump lied if he didn't remember the exact number off the top of his head.

Trump's reaction was good and genuine. We'll find out when they're released, and they will be.
Warren just does not grasp tactics. She falls into every one of Trumps traps and looks like a fool.
This is why Trump preemptively went after Warren. He knows they're vetting her, and she'll go in wounded by Trump right out the gate.
She will help Clinton with the majority of the Bernie supporters but some will still go for Trump.  

What I don't think they are seeing right now is that they won't be able to play the woman card at all. Think about it... 

Crooked/Goofy attack Trump, Trump fires back, they say "sexist! misogynist!" right? Well, Trump then fires back, "What, Crooked and Goofy can attack me, a man, but I can't attack them back simply because they're women? No, that's not how this works." 

They effectively take the woman card off the table. 
Going after Goofy Liz before she actually got the nomination was a masterstroke (as if we can expect anything less from the God Emperor!) for the following reasons:

1- If Crooked Hillary/Bernout **don't** pick her up after her name has been thrown around in the media, it will appear as though Trump ruined her enough to make her unviable and scared them away from their first choice.

2 - If they DO pick up Goofy Liz as VP, it makes it look like Trump predicted it and forced their choice for them. They are no longer making a choice for VP, they're making a choice to defy Donald Trump.

3 - The more she fights back before even getting the nomination, the more he can point at her and say "LOOK! She doesn't even work at her job *now*!" She either retaliates and appears to be another disgusting, lazy politician (true) or she just takes it and appears weak and afraid of Trump (also true).

#MASTER CLASS
Trump is playing professional Starcraft 2 while they are playing checkers.
Be careful. Trump's victory **DEPENDS** on having a strong base of independent and, yes, even ex-Bernie voters. Elizabeth Warren is very popular among both of those groups.

Do not underestimate her, Warren is an excellent pick, tactically.

She has the one scandal about her "Native-Americaness" but the Clinton campaign is no stranger to scandal; and neither is Trump.
Why is she being considered?  If her twitter attacks on Trump were the test she clearly failed.
**Election Results**

- Trump: 60%
- PC Matic: 25%
- Clinton 15%

Get the fuck out, Obamabot. Go shill somewhere else.
It's been interesting watching this sub since Trump is such a departure from typical republican policies, but lately it feels like all the typical free market, mah bootsraps! reagan/bush trickle-down cucks (is there anything more cuck sounding than trickle down?) have been slinking back and are trying to pretend they're Trump supporters to share in the limelight, as if they didn't totally get btfo by Trump. Because protectionist stuff like trade-tariff's to keep jobs in the u.s. for people that feel entitled to them over people in foreign countries who are willing to work harder and for less is totally neoliberal free-market policy right, or taxing the rich while having no taxes for people that make under 25k or a combined 50k? This meme would make as much sense in a hillary sub, at least she has a history of writing free trade deals and her husband cut welfare.

Trump is gonna drive those steaks directly into the hearts of the globalist vampires who are sucking this country dry. When it comes to great steaks he just raised the stakes. 
About sums up the anti-Trumpers on /r/politics.
I was actually paraphrasing a conversation I had with a redditor a couple of days ago. I mean it's all just the same talking points the anti-trump pacs have been pushing all year. You really gotta be a complete dumb dumb to buy into this stuff. What kind of warped sense of reality do these people have to look at a multi-billionaire businessman who just secured the republican nomination for President of the United States and they think he's a failure. I mean you can disagree with him all day about his policy ideas but how they deny his intelligence and his talent is beyond me. They're like children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "la la la Trump is a failure, I cherry picked three examples of his businesses that failed and ignore the rest of his massive success so nothing else counts la la la." It's pathethic. We're lucky our enemies are such cucks. They will be easily defeated. 
Actually, according to [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/university/donald-trump-biography/donald-trump-net-worth.asp), Trump inherited about 75 million dollars from his dad in 1999:

>In 1999, when patriarch Fred Trump died, his estate of between $250 – $300 million was divided equally among his four surviving children.

So, if Trump had invested that in a really really really good investment low risk portfolio with a return of 10% annually, he would have:

75

82.5

90.75

99.825

109.8075

120.78825

132.867075

146.1537825

160.7691608

176.8460768

194.5306845

213.983753

235.3821283

258.9203411

284.8123752

313.2936127

344.622974

379.0852714 million dollars

Instead of the 4.5 billion estimated by Forbes. So, that about him getting more money from a savings account is false. I mean, he started in a fairly well privileged position, but let’s keep the facts right (not pun intended).
The women's studies factories are only hiring illegal immigrants.   That's why I support Trump.


The artists text below comic makes it clear that they think Trump to be competitent:
  
> The fact that Donald Trump is the richest candidate, not because he was paid by some special interest, but because he is an accomplished competitor in the free market makes him an expertly qualified administrator. Some people will cite is brashness as evidence that he is not an intelligent leader, however, could it just possibly be that he is a billionaire because of (instead of in spite of) his demeanor?
Real estate is one of *the* classic ways to make money in human society. Look at how many real-estate developers own pro sports teams. Every big and small city in the US has real-estate people among its wealthy people.

What Trump did, however, is different. Four decades ago he was on paper absolutely no different from 500 other scions of moderately wealthy (as in, a few millions to tens of millions) property developers in the New York metro area. To turn that million-dollar loan into ten billion is, however, unusual; there aren't 50 real-estate multibillionaires in New York, let alone 500. To also become a household name *and* to have remained one for 30 years *and* turn that fame into a leading presidential candidacy? That takes brains.

I was not a Trump supporter, although I support him over Hillary. I recognize, however, that too often "idiot" is used in politics as a synonym for "anyone whose policies I oppose", regardless of that person's actual intelligence. Only an idiot would call Trump an idiot.
I thought it was supportive to Trump and quite funny. 
Donald Trump was worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, $4 billion by his own measures, when his dad died in 1999. Fred Trump left behind $300 million which, when divided among his wife and 4(5?) living children and after paying estate taxes, probably left Donald Trump with chump change.
Well, there you go. Trump is an excellent businessman. 
So Trump takes a million dollars of his dad's money and turns it into tens of billions and they call him an idiot. Bernie takes $200 million from poor liberal arts students and loses against literally the worst candidate for any office ever and they think he's brilliant.
Guys, it's **CURRENT YEAR**.

Trump? Really?
what you call management I call omniscience. If you knew exactly when to sell and exactly when to buy then I agree you could get more than 7% growth by transferring wealth from others to yourself. Donald Trump got ~30% growth by creating wealth.
Even if you don't support Trump you have to admit that he is a master businessman. People make fun of the "small loan of a million dollars" line, but in NY realest ate that is FUCKING NOTHING. 
You could have made a lot of money with long term passive investments assuming you:

* Never touch the principal
* Re-invest the vast majority of returns

I understand it may be your dream as a Portlander to start living like a retired person in your 20s. For Trump, that would have meant no apartment overlooking Manhattan, no personal 757, no Mar-a-Lago.

Pass.
According to who? or what criteria? 

Trump's doing pretty well, wouldn't you say? Would you agree he's at least doing *okay* as far as his financial situation goes?
https://m.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4aawkr/what_is_the_meaning_of_based/?ref=readnext_2
Trump does not see race sex gender all that bullshit. He sees potential and how good their work is, and pays accordingly.
Trump should retweet it
If only Trump could be more progressive like the muslims Hillary wants to send in who throw acid in the faces of women who want to pursue education and force rape victims to either marry their assailant or be sentenced to death.
What's funny is that Trump admited that there was unequal pay in his organization, but it favored women, absolutely no media blowback because it hurts Hillarys narrative.
The Hillary sub actually thinks this was a good negative ad that shows how sexist Trump is. 

Hahaha Jesus Christ these people live on a different planet. They don't want equal anything, that want special everything!
It's crazy what a landslide this is going to be.

Honestly, back at the end of last year, I was sceptical. She's Hillary Clinton after all. Basically entitled to the nomination, and pretty much the highest profile person running. But it's staggering how badly she is doing, and how Trump is pushing her buttons so well.
For a blue state, I've gotten a lot of supportive comments when I wear my Trump hoodie around in NY. Always in the doctor's office though I get a bunch of thumbs up and things, loooot of doctors seem to love him.
The opposition has used fear and shaming to play against the psyche of the population. That's why you saw Trump winning almost anywhere there was a real election while the caucuses lent more towards Cruz or another candidate, being more socially accepted to voice in front of your neighbors. 
I'm going to see Rob Zombie this Sunday, and I'm going to be wearing my Trump shirt and MAGA hat.
Fuck the Berniebots that have an issue. I try to wear my Cameron Lee High Energy hat with a Trump shirt (I have every color) all weekend in public in NY. I do get sketched out about restaurants though, I fear fluid contamination.
That's a great shirt, I was looking km Trump's website and I couldn't find that particular shirt. Could you link me to where you found it??
That Orlando and Central Florida area will be critical for Trump. It's been traditionally red with the space program and all their D.o.D. contracting. That is up until the shuttle program shut down, laying off 40k+, then the military spending for that area was decimated. North Florida is red while South is blue leaving Central purple. If Donald goes in there talking about continued spaceflight and beafing up training for the military, he'll win Florida no problem.
Serious question:

I'm a patriot living abroad as a digital nomad. I want some Trump merch because it's awesome and would make some of these euro's salty as fuck, but Trump doesn't ship over seas.

What do I need to do to get some God Emperor material?
If you want the official Donald J Trump made in America shirts off his website, I'm sure one of us centipedes could receive it and send it to you. 
Aliexpress sell Trump stuff.
#Orlando area is pretty based - home of the greatest Trump Rally
Assuming it's Disneyland, then you're actually really brave. Hell as someone who lives in OC I'd never get a Trump bumper sticker on my car because the odds of me going to cities like Santa Ana and having it unscathed or even me not getting harassed are low.
It's sad as fuck that it's considered "brave" to wear Trump gear and openly support a presidential candidate. I have heard the same things here in Los Angeles. It shows the silent majority is real but also how horrible the left and the media are.
Yeah, many people in history have done their jobs right, for better or worse. Whether this is the best system or necessary isn't the point. The point is her ability to live comfortably with this, or even delight in the anecdote. And let's face it, were it Trump this would be headline news for months.
Holy fucking shit I could get hundreds more people to vote for him if he did this.

Trump = Big Boss?

Also, Huey sounds eerily similar to Hillary. Just saying.
President Trump and Kojima will show konami "big league", generating the highest sales ever seen!
>"How exactly will he MAGA? He doesn't ever say how."

Cuckservatives do this too. They say Trump never offers plans or details, when in fact he does so constantly. That's why he's often set upon by the media and gets all the attention. Everyone else is, "Blah blah...middle class...Wall Street...Washington Establishment..." same old shit we hear every election. You can philosophize all day long, but that doesn't work against a practical, common sense, hands-on guy like Trump.
Trump will make America great again by driving out annoying celebrities and Liberals
He'll also say it after a 2 hour plus rally in which he talks about all of his plans and proposals. He also has his positions clearly stated on his website. Anti-Trump folks are just ignorant and proud of their ignorance. 
Trump: under my presidency, Ubisoft will never be able to release a bad port again, and when they downgrade the graphics, there will be consequences, BUH-LIEVE ME 
For srs though, liberals and cuckservatives love throwing out there "BUT HOW!? NO SUBSTANCE! HE NEVER EXPLAINS!" 

Go to his website, watch his foreign policy speech. Actually watch a rally. For fucks sake he's put his plans out there insofar as he can without the necessary info he needs as president.  

Meanwhile it seems everyone else was running on the platform of stopping Trump. How substantial. 
American wide summer sales. Free games when you do your taxes. Possibilities are endless. 

Trump/Gaben 2016 
Obama brought back arrested development. If Trump can HL3, I'll MAGA. 
He shouldnt have to say how. He's Donald Trump. Making things great is literaly what he does all day. He cant help but makes things great.
Just winning the presidency and not hating America would be a huge improvement over "I have an interesting voice so no more freedom, **folks**".

When Trump is the Lord Captain Commander, hopefully he'll be able to scrub clean the word folks so that it can be used by normal lads again.
tired of this cuck trying to bandwagon off of the glorious leader Trump
ah yeah,,,that exactly the point to reach a bigger audience and start uncucking people and simply not engagins is starting to not work just like demonizing people isnt, perfect example 

#Lord God Emperor Trump 
Some sad pathetic cuck downvoted you. Take my UpTrump!  NEVER GIVE IN. NEVER GIVE UP!
I love how this Muslim-fag is complaining about Trump. You know you're doing something right when the 7th century barbarians are getting pissed at you. 
To be honest, I'm not sure Trump eats bacon either. He doesn't drink or smoke, stands to reason he'd cut out fatty foods too. I just don't see it.
The guy says Trump words make people radicalize..
